# Secrets: source of truth

> Owner directive 2026-09-18: **Infisical is the sole source of truth for every secret.** No `.env`
> files anywhere — not `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.*`, `.env.yml`, or
> `.env.yaml`. The committed `.env.example` is bootstrap-only (Infisical machine identity +
> `ENCRYPTION_KEY` + the optional `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER` arming flag); every other operator
> knob, feature flag, provider key, broker credential, RAG fuse, and per-lane budget moved to
> Infisical (shared / shared-at-ct / app projects), per-user Settings, or in-code defaults.
> See `docs/rollouts/2026-09-18-strict-infisical-no-env-files.md` for the migration and
> `test/no-env-loader-or-dotenv-yaml.test.ts` for the regression guard.

## Three secrets homes

| Layer | Provider | What's there | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap (the box) | macOS login Keychain (service `socratic-trade-bootstrap`) + `process.env` | Infisical machine identity only — Client ID + Client Secret (universal auth) | `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID`, `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INFISICAL_TOKEN`, `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`, `INFISICAL_ENV`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY` |
| Shared fleet | Infisical `shared` project | Coordination keys shared across ST/CT/UM | `AGENT_SYNC_*`, Slack bot token, shared Coolify read-only stats token |
| App runtime | Infisical `Socratic-Trade` `prod` `/` (via runner) | Broker creds, provider keys, RAG fuses, feature flags, telemetry tokens | `ALPACA_*`, `FINNHUB_*`, `MASSIVE_*`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `RAG_*`, `EARNINGSCALLS_*` |
| Per-user | User Settings (`user_settings` row + `user_api_keys` table) | User-scoped runtime data | per-account LLM model, per-user LLM key, per-account policy, per-user Data source opt-ins |

**LLM runtime keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) are NOT Infisical secrets for this
app** — they belong on the user's Connections page (`user_api_keys`). Deleted from Infisical
2026-08-15 (GEMINI/DEEPSEEK were the last remaining); `scripts/infisical-secrets-safe.sh set`
refuses those names. The owner keeps exactly one key per provider per app, with spend caps
deliberately configured; agent provisioning is a fleet rule (see AGENTS.md "NEVER create a new
provider API key").

## How it works

`npm run start:secrets` starts `scripts/infisical-run.mjs`. In the normal non-watch path, the runner
authenticates, calls `infisical export` with a minimal CLI-only environment, merges the exported
values over the app's ambient environment, and starts the requested command through
`scripts/infisical-app-child.mjs`. Shared-overlay mode exports both projects the same way and lets
the app project win overlaps. `INFISICAL_WATCH=true` is the exception: the Infisical CLI owns its
watch loop and starts the same final wrapper after each injection. Every path sets
`SECRETS_SOURCE=infisical` before Next boots.

Exports use the CLI's JSON format rather than reparsing dotenv text, preserving multiline values,
quotes, backslashes, and whitespace exactly. Pinned Infisical CLI v0.43.98 emits a JSON array of
secret records; the runner copies only each record's validated string `key` and `value` and ignores
metadata. Non-array shapes, malformed or duplicate entries, invalid environment keys, and NUL bytes
fail with raw CLI output suppressed.

**Auth (per project):** the runner authenticates the machine identity with its **Client ID + Client
Secret** (universal auth, long-lived) — set `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID` + `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET` and it
exchanges them for a fresh access token on every launch via `infisical login --method=universal-auth
… --plain`, then passes that token only to the required `export` or watch operation (nothing expires
between deploys). A pre-minted `INFISICAL_TOKEN` (a short-lived JWT) is still accepted as a fallback.
**The Client Secret is not the access token** — pasting a 64-char Client Secret into
`INFISICAL_TOKEN` is the "malformed token" 403; use the Client ID + Secret pair instead. Within one
precedence source, a complete Client ID + Secret pair wins over a stale token.

### Local machine-identity bootstrap

`scripts/infisical-run.mjs` must authenticate before Next starts, so it resolves its own small
bootstrap set first. Precedence is explicit process environment, then `.env.local` runner controls,
then (macOS only) the owner's login Keychain. The Keychain is the documented identity store for the
owner's Mac; cloud VMs and CI supply the same names through the process environment and skip the
Keychain quietly. `~/.secrets/global-api-keys` is retired and is never read (owner, 2026-10-18,
OPS-818; it overrides the 2026-09-18 rule that kept that file as the bootstrap identity store).

Keychain layout: one generic password per name, service `socratic-trade-bootstrap`, account = the
env var name (for example `INFISICAL_ST_CLIENT_ID`). Add or replace an item without putting the
value on a command line by omitting the value after `-w`; `security` then prompts for it:

```bash
security add-generic-password -U -s socratic-trade-bootstrap -a INFISICAL_ST_CLIENT_ID -w
security add-generic-password -U -s socratic-trade-bootstrap -a INFISICAL_ST_CLIENT_SECRET -w
```

The resolver reads each item with `security find-generic-password -s socratic-trade-bootstrap -a
NAME -w` through a list-argv call (no shell), captures stdout, discards stderr, and treats a missing
or unreadable item as absent. `scripts/predev-check.mjs` only checks that the items exist (no `-w`).
Set `SOCRATIC_BOOTSTRAP_KEYCHAIN=off` to skip the Keychain entirely (the test suite does).

Only the six recognized account names below are ever requested; provider/API keys are never read
from the Keychain or copied into `process.env` or child processes.

The generic runner names remain `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID` + `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET` for the app and
`INFISICAL_SHARED_CLIENT_ID` + `INFISICAL_SHARED_CLIENT_SECRET` for the shared overlay when supplied
through the process environment. The Keychain is narrower: it accepts only
`INFIISICAL_ST_*` (the owner-provided extra-I spelling) or corrected `INFISICAL_ST_*` for this app,
and `INFISICAL_CT_SHARED_*` for the shared project. It does not import generic app/shared names,
tokens, project IDs, runtime controls, provider keys, or cross-app credentials from the Keychain.
The resolver normalizes the selected pair in memory only, never prints/copies a value, and refuses a
higher-precedence half-pair instead of combining fields across files.

The runner snapshots the selected identity, immediately removes every bootstrap credential from its
own long-lived `process.env`, and clears each auth object after its synchronous token mint/copy. The
CLI probe/login/export environment is a small OS/network allowlist plus only the credential needed by
that operation; ambient provider, GitHub, Slack, broker, and cross-app secrets never transit the
Infisical CLI. Raw login/export failure output is suppressed because a CLI could echo its
environment. Normal and overlay application children still receive their ambient app environment
directly from the trusted runner plus Infisical exports. Watch mode intentionally receives only the
small runtime allowlist plus Infisical-managed values, so credentials needed by a watched app must be
stored in Infisical rather than inherited from the shell. `INFISICAL_DOMAIN` is retained explicitly
for EU/self-hosted routing while remaining masked from the final app.

Before starting the Node final wrapper, `/usr/bin/env` removes `NODE_OPTIONS`, `BASH_ENV`, and `ENV`
so injected preload hooks cannot execute before bootstrap masking. The wrapper then restores the
intended `NODE_OPTIONS` only after installing every empty mask, preserves command argv without shell
evaluation, and forwards termination signals through the process chain. Normal export mode safely
restores the manager-winning `NODE_OPTIONS`; watch mode cannot inspect dynamic injected values before
the CLI spawns its child, so it deliberately discards an Infisical-injected `NODE_OPTIONS` and
restores only the pre-Infisical host value after masking.

An ambient `GLOBAL_API_KEYS_FILE` override from the retired flat-file design is ignored and
scrubbed from the environment. Keychain lookups use `/usr/bin/security` with a fixed argv and a
10-second timeout; no value is ever interpolated into a shell command, a log line, or an error.
Errors name the Keychain service and the account to add, never a value.

The Socratic-Trade project defaults to `39d93bb7-76f9-498c-8b50-a7def52e072f`. The shared project
defaults to `18f563a3-9c88-454c-96eb-28fc9678f3ba` only when shared credentials are actually present
(or an operator explicitly sets `INFISICAL_SHARED_PROJECT_ID`), so app-only setups do not
accidentally enable an inaccessible overlay. A shared overlay without an explicit app identity/token
fails before either project is fetched. `scripts/cloud-setup.sh` runs a value-free bootstrap check
after seeding local defaults; a missing identity remains valid for keyless local UI work, but
any recognized incomplete pair fails closed before an Infisical CLI call.

## Enforcement (fail-closed boot guard)

`src/lib/secrets-source.ts` exposes `assertSecretsManagerIfRequired()`; it's called from
`instrumentation.ts:51` at the top of the `nodejs` boot path, before any other credential is read.
When `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER=1` is set, the app refuses to boot unless `SECRETS_SOURCE=infisical`
(i.e. it was launched through `start:secrets` or `dev:secrets`).

- **Prod Coolify (`socratic-app`):** armed. `scripts/coolify-prod-start.sh` exports
  `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER=1` in the phase-2 re-exec under `infisical-run.mjs` (line ~117), so the
  policy is visible at the shell level instead of buried in Infisical config.
- **Local dev / tests / CI:** OFF (default). Plain `npm run dev` still works for tests and
  UI-only development. To load keys, run `npm run dev:secrets`.
- **Escape hatch:** unset `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER` (Infisical) or comment the export in
  `coolify-prod-start.sh` for a single rebuild during a recovery drill. Document any change in
  `docs/rollouts/`.

## What this means for a fresh cloud seat

`scripts/cloud-setup.sh` is the canonical setup for Claude Code cloud, devcontainers, Codespaces,
and throwaway clones. As of 2026-09-18:

1. `npm ci` (deterministic install).
2. Bootstrap check: `node scripts/infisical-bootstrap-env.mjs` resolves the Infisical machine
   identity from process env OR the macOS login Keychain (macOS only). Cloud VMs have no Keychain
   and silently no-op here — keyless local UI work is fine; any LLM/broker provider needs
   the identity in place.
3. Slack coordination `SETUP` (SessionStart hook) — non-fatal skip on hiccup.
5. Final echo: `npm run dev:secrets   (Infisical runner on :3000)`. Plain `npm run dev` is for
   tests-only; it no longer reads `.env.local`.

A `predev` hook (`scripts/predev-check.mjs`) runs before plain `npm run dev` and prints a one-time
notice when no Infisical identity is in scope — it never fails the boot, because tests and pure-UI
development must still start.

## One-time migration (already complete on main)

This is the historical record of the 2026-06-25 Infisical cutover. Current prod runs Infisical-only
via Coolify. If you are migrating a new environment or a rollback lane:

```bash
brew install infisical/get-cli/infisical   # or: npm i -g @infisical/cli
infisical login                            # -> Infisical Cloud
infisical init                             # link the project + env
# bulk-import your existing local secrets into the prod env:
infisical secrets set --env=prod --path=/ $(grep -vE '^\s*#|^\s*$' .env.local | xargs)
# or: Infisical dashboard -> project -> Secrets -> "Import .env" -> upload .env.local
```

Then create a **Machine Identity** (Project -> Access Control) with the **Universal Auth** method and
copy its **Client ID** (UUID — not secret) and a **Client Secret** (64-char string — secret, never
committed). App secrets live in the **`Socratic-Trade`** project (slug `socratic-trade`); shared
App-A/B (congress-trade) secrets live in **`shared-at-ct`**
(`18f563a3-9c88-454c-96eb-28fc9678f3ba`). To pull both, give the runner a SECOND identity via
`INFISICAL_SHARED_CLIENT_ID` + `INFISICAL_SHARED_CLIENT_SECRET` (and optionally
`INFISICAL_SHARED_PROJECT_ID`): the runner fetches both projects with `infisical export` and merges
them with the **app project winning** any overlapping key (shared is the fallback).

On the box set the bootstrap:

```bash
export INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID='<machine-identity Client ID>'          # a UUID; identifier, not a secret
export INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET='<machine-identity Client Secret>'  # the 64-char secret; never committed
export INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID='39d93bb7-76f9-498c-8b50-a7def52e072f' # Socratic-Trade (slug: socratic-trade)
export INFISICAL_ENV='prod'
export REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER=1     # arm the fail-closed boot guard (prod only)
```

The **Client Secret is not an access token** — the runner exchanges the Client ID + Secret for a
short-lived token at each launch, so nothing in `deploy.env` expires. (A pre-minted `INFISICAL_TOKEN`
is accepted as a fallback, but it expires — see the identity's Access Token TTL.)

Once Coolify's boot script picks the bootstrap up, verify:
- the app boots and reads its keys (and that, with `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER=1`, a plain
  `next start` now refuses to boot);
- `cat .env.example` is bootstrap-only (Infisical identity + `ENCRYPTION_KEY` +
  `REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER`) — if not, this PR's `.env.example` isn't on your tree yet;
- `npx tsc --noEmit && npm test && npm run build` are green;
- `git grep -nE '"\.env\.local"|resolve\(process\.cwd\(\), *["'"'"']\.env\.local' src app`
  returns zero hits (the CI guard `test/no-env-loader-or-dotenv-yaml.test.ts` enforces this).
