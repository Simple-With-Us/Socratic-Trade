# 2026-07-15 - Post-Codex/AG audit + app evaluation → MONET handoff (CLAUDE)

## Summary

Owner-directed evaluation sweep of Socratic-Trade after Codex/Antigravity changes, run from
isolated worktree branch `claude/adoring-hopper-4ff51e`. No product source changed in this lane;
the deliverable is a synthesized, adversarially-verified findings + action document handed to
MONET, plus two side-fixes that landed in adjacent repos/infra.

Method: two multi-agent workflows —
1. Branch-disposition + effort-board-hygiene + API-Usage-Monitor-integration audit (40 agents
   over 73 branches + 54 merged PRs + the cross-repo integration).
2. A 5-lane app evaluation (UI/UX, data-streams, RAG/learning, autonomy-framework,
   backend-hardening) with adversarial per-finding verification.

## Why

The owner wanted confirmation that all Codex/AG improvements are merged to production, the
effort board is honest, the shared dependency and API-Usage-Monitor integration are correct, and
a prioritized list of UI/UX + framework/backend improvements toward an optimized self-learning
trading system.

## What was verified (facts)

- Production current + healthy: `main@294694ae` (== origin/main HEAD), all providers green,
  scheduler leased/ticking, litestream replicating. No open ST PRs; all Codex/AG work through
  #1624 merged and auto-deployed.
- `congress-trading-shared` current on BOTH consumers: pin `0bc26ab9` = shared main = v1.7.1.
  No drift.
- Branch audit: main is not missing any squash-merged PR content. Identified a small
  UNMERGED-VALUABLE set (`codex/autofix-rag-limits-fix` STATUS correction, `ag/codex-autofix-1476`
  a11y fixes, `ag/loading-animation` HeaderLogo prop) and 3 FLAGGED never-PR'd branches
  (`claude/w2-coaching-durable`, `claude/w2-reflection-decompose`, `claude/delegation-standard-docs`)
  with real features absent from main (need rebase). Everything else is merged-artifact/superseded/stale.
- Effort-board hygiene: found missing rows (#1482, #1614), stale In-Progress rows for merged PRs
  (#1593/#1594/#1604/#1492 sub-efforts/TS-7.0.2), a verbatim duplicated paragraph, and mirror drift.
  Corrections list is in the handoff §2 (not yet applied — handed to MONET to avoid churn during
  concurrent lane edits).
- API-Usage-Monitor integration: DEGRADED — a real ~2× Voyage RAG dollar double-count (dispatch
  lane + ledger lane both push cost; receiver aggregates across `service`), plus an FMP
  request-count double-emission (no $ impact). Bridge writer #1624 correctly default-off; reader
  PRs #286/#293 confirmed merged on the monitor side.

## Side-fixes LANDED this session

- Congress.Trade `Shared package pin check` false-positive: PR #450 (MERGED). `git+ssh` vs
  `git+https` transport for the same shared commit; fixed by normalizing the ref after `#`.
  See `Congress.Trade/docs/rollouts/2026-07-15-pin-check-transport-normalize.md`.
- `ag***-s**c-push` pm2 crash-loop (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND: ws`, ~877k restarts) repaired: reinstalled
  deps, added `.janitor-keep` to stop the disk-janitor reaping its `node_modules`, restarted.

## Files

- `docs/handoffs/2026-07-15-claude-to-monet-st-audit.md` — the synthesized handoff (primary deliverable).
- `STATUS.md`, `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`, `/Users/jay/apps/TRADING-EFFORT-LOG.md` — updated.
- `docs/rollouts/2026-07-15-post-codex-ag-audit-monet-handoff.md` — this note.
- (Congress.Trade repo, separate PR #450) `.github/workflows/shared-package-pin-check.yml`.

## Verification

- `curl socratictrade.com/api/health` → `main@294694ae`, all green.
- `git` pin comparison: ST `package.json` and CT `app/package.json` both `#0bc26ab9…`;
  shared repo `main` HEAD = `0bc26ab` (v1.7.1).
- All app-evaluation findings adversarially verified against `src/` (each has a CONFIRMED/REFUTED
  verdict with file:line evidence in the workflow journals). One backend finding REFUTED
  (account-deletion bridge revocation — narrower than claimed) and excluded from action items.

## Follow-ups (owned by MONET, per handoff §8)

Prioritized list in the handoff. Do-now/low-effort highlights: re-fire `recordClosedLotExperience`
on reconciliation (live trades feed episodic memory); wire FMP price-targets + ROE/ROA into the
prompt; `global-error.tsx` dark-mode fix; deregister Alpha Vantage when Alpaca key present; the
effort-board hygiene pass; balanced counterfactuals; the Voyage double-count (cross-repo). Larger:
retrieval-usefulness join, decide fate of the two orphaned episodic doc-type branches, QuiverQuant
producer, NAV_V2 resume. All code fixes land via separate PRs, dormant/default-off where money-path.
