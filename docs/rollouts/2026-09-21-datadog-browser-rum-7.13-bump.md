# 2026-09-21 — Codex-autofix for the @datadog/browser-rum 7.9.0 → 7.13.0 bump (PR #3446)

## Context & Objective

Dependabot bumped `@datadog/browser-rum` from `^7.9.0` to `^7.13.0` (PR #3446, branch
`dependabot/npm_and_yarn/datadog/browser-rum-7.13.0`, commit `4d293a14ba`).  The commit touched only
`package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

Codex review (P1, thread on `package.json:39`) flagged that the commit omits the repo's mandatory
handoff records — `STATUS.md`, the effort log, a `docs/rollouts/` note, and the `PLAN.md` entry — so
the dependency change would be invisible to subsequent agents and to the owner, and its commit
message could not reference the required documentation (AGENTS.md L37–L61, the Pre-Commit / Handoff
Protocol).  This codex-autofix round adds those records so PR #3446 clears the review gate.

## Changes Made

- `STATUS.md` — dated snapshot entry for the bump and this round.
- `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` — `[codex-autofix]` row (runtime dependency-only; in progress).
- `PLAN.md` — scope note (no roadmap change; runtime dependency-only) per the handoff protocol.
- `docs/rollouts/2026-09-21-datadog-browser-rum-7.13-bump.md` — this note.
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — the Dependabot commit `4d293a14ba` itself (authored by
  Dependabot, untouched by this lane apart from the doc additions above).

No production source file changed in this round.  `src/lib/datadog-rum.ts` was read and left as-is;
see Decisions below.

## Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Classified as runtime, not docs-only.**  `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are runtime
  `watch_paths` for the Coolify auto-deploy, so the handoff records call this a runtime
  dependency-only change rather than "no runtime code changed" — the same correction Codex asked for
  on PR #3178 (see `docs/rollouts/2026-09-07-codex-autofix-observability-group-bump.md`).  On merge
  it is image-deploy material: it is subject to the weekday RTH latch and needs no `HOTFIX`.
- **Same-major bump, no code change required.**  All four locked packages move within major 7
  (`@datadog/browser-rum` / `browser-core` / `browser-rum-core` 7.9.0 → 7.13.0; transitive
  `@datadog/js-core` 0.0.10 → 0.0.14).  The only call site is `src/lib/datadog-rum.ts:24`, which
  dynamically imports the module, casts it to a local three-method `RumSdk` type (`init` +
  `addError`), and passes only long-stable `init` options — `applicationId`, `clientToken`, `site`,
  `service`, `env`, `version`, `sessionSampleRate`, `sessionReplaySampleRate`,
  `trackUserInteractions`, `trackResources`, `trackLongTasks`, `defaultPrivacyLevel`,
  `allowedTracingUrls`, `beforeSend`.  No deprecated or removed option is used, so nothing needed
  changing.
- **Failure mode is unchanged and fail-soft.**  `startDatadogRum` is wrapped in `try`/`catch` that
  resets `rumStarted`/`rumSdk` and degrades to a single `console.warn`; `captureRumError` swallows
  everything by design ("Telemetry must never throw").  A bad SDK version therefore cannot take down
  a page render, and the local `RumSdk` cast means a type-level difference in the SDK would not be
  visible to `tsc` — the guard is the runtime catch, not the compiler.
- **No live effect today.**  RUM send stays dark: `DD_RUM_ENABLED=false` in Infisical, and the
  `Socratic Trade` RUM app remains `is_active=false` (STATUS.md, 2026-09-18 GROK — Datadog remaining).
  This bump is therefore inert at runtime until RUM is deliberately switched on, which is why the
  round did not need a deploy-verification step.
- **`@datadog/browser-logs` was not pulled in.**  It appears in the lockfile only as an *optional*
  peer of `browser-rum` (`peerDependenciesMeta.optional: true`); it stays uninstalled, and the app's
  log path remains Sentry + the in-app health pipeline, per the same 2026-09-18 decision.

## Verification State

Run on this lane after `npm install` (which installed `@datadog/browser-rum@7.13.0`, matching the
lockfile):

```bash
npm run lint       # PASS — exit 0, 0 errors / 819 grandfathered warnings
npx tsc --noEmit   # PASS — exit 0
npm test           # 8144 passed / 13 failed / 51 skipped across 746 files (887s)
npm run build      # PASS — exit 0
```

The 13 failures are **pre-existing and unrelated to this change**.  They are all LLM provider
key-routing assertions in `test/chat-llm.test.ts` (2), `test/framework-review.test.ts`,
`test/llm-provider.test.ts` and `test/openrouter-credits.test.ts`, e.g. `expected OpenAILLM{ …(6) }
to be an instance of AnthropicLLM` at `test/chat-llm.test.ts:430`.  They exercise the per-user key
store versus the `LLM_OPERATOR_FALLBACK` precedence path, which is sensitive to which provider keys
are injected into the seat — this cloud seat has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set and no OpenAI key, and the
repo's `verify` CI gate runs without those seat secrets and is authoritative.  This is the same
failure class documented on PR #3178
(`docs/rollouts/2026-09-07-codex-autofix-observability-group-bump.md`).  This lane's diff touches
**zero** files under `src/`, `app/`, `test/` or `ios/`, so it cannot have caused them.

Two pieces of unrelated churn were produced by the local toolchain and deliberately **reverted**
before commit, not shipped:

- `package-lock.json` — `npm install` stripped `libc: ["glibc"]` from ~90 lines of optional
  platform-specific packages (npm-version normalization, not the Dependabot bump).  Reverted to the
  branch tip, so the lockfile in this PR is byte-identical to Dependabot's commit `4d293a14ba`.
- `ios/SocraticTradeTests/Fixtures/policy-contract.json` — the test suite regenerated
  `learningReviewModel` `claude-fable-5` → `claude-fable-latest` (model-catalog drift).  Reverted.

`next-env.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json` were checked after `npm run build` and were **not** modified by
this build, so no restore was needed.

## Files

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `docs/rollouts/2026-09-21-datadog-browser-rum-7.13-bump.md`

## Follow-ups

- None.  RUM stays dark by owner decision; do not enable RUM send or mint a second Datadog RUM app
  as part of this bump.

## Blockers

- None.

## Round 2 — MUSE PR-merge sweep (2026-09-21)

Codex's remaining P1 on this PR was that the round-1 commit message described only the
dependency bump and never referenced the handoff files it added (`STATUS.md`, `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`,
`PLAN.md`, this note).  Two-part response: (a) this round's commit message enumerates the updated
docs explicitly, and (b) the squash-merge message will keep that enumeration so the permanent
history names every handoff file, per the AGENTS.md requirement that every commit message
identify which docs were updated.

This round also merges current `origin/main` (picks up #3445 jose 6.2.12, #3426, #3427).  The merge
auto-resolved cleanly; `@datadog/browser-rum` is verified at `^7.13.0` (lock 7.13.0) in the merged
`package.json` / `package-lock.json`.  Documentation + main-merge only — no dependency or source
change beyond the merge, so no local re-run of the lint/tsc/test/build gates; the required
`verify` CI check re-runs on push and is the authoritative gate.  Extra-ship no.  No Coolify Deploy.
