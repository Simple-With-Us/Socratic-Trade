# 2026-09-24 — Strategy Run Halt And Restart Resilience (Lane B `st-run-resilience`)

Seat CLAUDE, board `687a5fb4`, branch `claude/st-run-resilience`.

## 1. Context & Objective

Production, Alpaca Paper, last 50 strategy runs (2026-09-22 13:39Z → 09-24 19:20Z): only 14
completed.  23 were `skipped_broker_unhealthy` — 21x "Broker cannot place orders — autonomous
strategy auto-paused: Broker health check timed out: checkBrokerHealth timeout" and 2x "Broker
connectivity failure: Timed out waiting for alpaca.getAccount after 16000+8000ms." — and 11 were
"Process restarted mid-run — marked failed by stale-run sweep".  The timeouts coincide with RTH
event-loop stalls (the process was frozen, not Alpaca), and operators restart the container about
every 20 minutes during those stalls.  Objective: stop first-strike halts on probe timeouts, stop
blaming the broker for a frozen process, make sure pauses lift (auto) or stick (owner) correctly,
and give a restart-killed run that provably placed nothing exactly one retry.

## 2. Changes Made

**Root cause (halts).**  `applyBrokerOrderPlacementPause` only applied the
`BROKER_CONNECTIVITY_HALT_STREAK = 3` gate when `isTransientNetworkError(reason)` matched, and that
classifier matches socket tokens (`fetch failed`, `ECONNRESET`, …), not the prose "timed out".  Both
production timeout shapes therefore auto-halted Autopilot on the FIRST occurrence, fired a
kill-switch notification, and auto-resumed a tick later — 21 flaps in two days.  The scheduler also
wrapped the probe in a plain `withDeadline`, so the expiry could not say whether the 30s went to
Alpaca or to a pinned event loop.

**Root cause (restarts).**  `markStaleRunningRuns` marked restart-killed runs failed and nothing
re-queued them.  Worse, its audit-activity grace counted rows the DEAD process wrote before this
process booted, holding every killed run in `running` for up to 30 more minutes — by which time the
next cadence run had started, so the lost run could never be retried anyway.

- **Structural timeout flag.**  `withDeadline` and `awaitWithFirstCallRetry` (final timeout) now tag
  the error they manufacture with `__deadlineTimeout` (`markDeadlineTimeout` /
  `isDeadlineTimeoutError`).  `checkBrokerHealth` sets `HealthSignals.probeTimedOut` from that flag
  (plus the lane-expiry marker and AbortError/TimeoutError by name) — no prose regex, and
  `isTransientNetworkError` is NOT widened (GROK lesson 2026-09-18).
- **Streak for timeouts.**  `applyBrokerOrderPlacementPause` counts `probeTimedOut` toward the same
  3-in-a-row streak as a dead socket.  A healthy probe still resets it.
- **Process-stall attribution.**  The scheduler probe now uses `withLaneDeadline` (lane
  `broker-health-probe`), and `checkBrokerHealth` measures its own window with the lag sampler.
  When ≥75% of a timed-out probe window was event-loop stall (`PROBE_STALL_ATTRIBUTION_RATIO`, pinned
  equal to `LANE_STALL_ATTRIBUTION_RATIO` by a test), the health signal carries `processStall` and
  the reason "App process was stalled (event loop blocked Xs of Ys); broker not at fault".  The tick
  skips its strategy launch, the streak is neither incremented nor reset, and an audit row
  `broker_health_probe_process_stalled` plus the `broker-health-gate` journal row record it.  An
  in-run stalled probe finishes the run as the generic `skipped` (audit `run_skipped_process_stalled`)
  instead of `skipped_broker_unhealthy`.  No new run status was added (see Decisions).
- **Pause ownership.**  `applyBrokerOrderPlacementPause` now decides against the durable policy,
  re-read right before it writes, and writes only `systemState`.  Before, it decided on the caller's
  snapshot (read before a probe of up to 30s) and persisted the whole snapshot: an owner Pause that
  landed mid-probe was claimed as an auto-pause (and later auto-resumed), any setting the owner
  edited in that window was reverted, and a Manual Run once could persist its run-scoped
  `strategyAuthority: "propose"`.  New `releaseBrokerPlacementPauseToOwner` drops the auto-resume
  marker when the owner pauses (`/api/strategy/pause`, mobile `strategy.stop`) and at the boot
  interlock when `autoResumeOnBoot` is off, so an owner halt is never auto-lifted.
- **Broker-lane ceiling reconciled.**  `SCHEDULER_BROKER_TIMEOUT_MS` was 15s, below the 16s first
  wait of the Alpaca reads it wraps.  It is now first+retry+6s = 30s (same as the inner broker I/O
  deadline and the health probe).  The awaited material-event drain keeps its own 15s
  (`MATERIAL_EVENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS`) so tick latency does not grow.
- **One-time restart retry.**  `sweepStaleRunningRuns` returns the restart-killed rows it
  transitioned; new `src/lib/strategy-run-retry.ts` queues ONE `strategy_run_requests` row for the
  killed run's account when all hold: scheduler-launched run (no request row — never a Manual Run
  once, never a retry), no `trade_proposals` / `fill_events` / `socratic_decisions` rows for the run,
  no run-scoped trigger override, no live lease, account `active`, session open
  (`isRunAllowedNow`), no newer or running run on the account, no open request for the user.  Pre-boot
  runs now only get the audit-activity grace for rows written since this process booted.  Migration
  92 adds `strategy_run_requests.connected_account_id` + `retry_of_run_id` with a partial UNIQUE
  index (at most one retry per killed run).  The drain runs a retry non-manually on that account,
  re-validates it first (10-minute max queue age), and never adopts a retry interrupted by another
  restart.  Receipts: `strategy_run_retry_enqueued` / `_skipped` / `_dropped`.

## 3. Decisions & Trade-offs

- **No new run status.**  iOS decodes `StrategyRunItem.status` as a plain `String` (no strict enum,
  so no decode failure), but `ActivityView.swift` maps unknown statuses to "Completed" with the
  positive color.  A `skipped_process_stalled` status would render as a green "Completed" on the
  shipped app.  The generic `skipped` renders "Skipped" everywhere; the audit kind carries the
  distinction.  The scheduler-gate stall skip writes no `strategy_runs` row (same as every
  non-halting gate skip — the cadence is not advanced, so the next tick launches).
- **Retry disables on ANY proposal/fill/decision row**, stricter than "placed": a `proposed` row
  awaiting approval would otherwise be duplicated by the retry.
- **No broker-side order listing before a retry.**  Strategy placement persists the `placing`
  trade_proposals row (run_id + refId = clientOrderId) BEFORE the broker call and skips the call if
  that insert fails, so "zero proposal rows" already proves the run never called `placeEquityOrder`.
  refIds are random UUIDs, not run-prefixed, so a by-run broker listing is not possible without
  changing the refId format in the placement path (lanes C/D).
- **Manual and API-requested runs are never retried** — owner-initiated work stays owner-initiated,
  and a propose-only manual run must not come back as an autonomous one.
- **Queue interplay.**  `queueStrategyRunRequest` dedupes per user, so a Manual Run once click while a
  retry is queued (at most one tick) is deduped onto the retry.  Accepted: short window, and it keeps
  the queue single-flight per user.  **Superseded by the review round below** — the window was not
  one tick (a running retry is minutes of LLM work), and the owner's run was lost, not delayed.
- **Migration version 92.**  Parallel lanes that add a migration will conflict textually at the end of
  `MIGRATIONS`; the later lander renumbers.
- **Broker-lane ceiling 15s → 30s** lengthens the worst case of the awaited in-run maintenance pass,
  deliberately: the pass now waits for a read that is still legitimately retrying instead of racing
  ahead of it.  The void scheduler lanes only change attribution.

## 4. Verification State

Host load average was 400–700 during this session (parallel lanes), so wall-clock numbers are
inflated.

- `npx vitest run test/broker-health-probe-resilience.test.ts` — 17 passed (the mobile
  `strategy.stop`-on-top-of-an-auto-pause case was added in a follow-up commit after the full gate).
- `npx vitest run test/strategy-run-restart-retry.test.ts` — 14 passed.
- Regression proof: with the two core fixes reverted in place (streak condition, pre-boot activity
  floor), "does not halt on the first alpaca.getAccount timeout", "does not halt on the first
  scheduler probe-deadline expiry", and "sweeps a pre-boot run promptly…" fail; restored, they pass.
- Related suites (broker-health-auto-pause, transient-network-resilience, stale-running-runs,
  stale-running-runs-adoption-grace, scheduler-boot-halt-notify, route-strategy-pause,
  scheduler-lane-observability, scheduler-stale-exit-inflight-guard, broker-io-deadlines,
  inflight-deadline, persistence-hardening, strategy-run-drain-handoff, mobile-api,
  strategy-run-status, scheduler-tick-reentrancy, scheduler-leader-heartbeat) — green after pointing
  the heartbeat test's mock at `sweepStaleRunsAndRetry`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; eslint on changed files 0 errors.
- Full gate, in order, on `e9914c424`: `npm run lint` 0 errors / 830 pre-existing warnings;
  `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm test` 756 files passed / 1 skipped, 8302 tests passed / 51 skipped,
  0 failed; `npm run build` clean (compiled with the pre-existing middleware-to-proxy warning).
- `scripts/land.sh` armed auto-merge after pushing; it was disabled immediately
  (`gh pr merge 3752 --disable-auto`) because this lane is money-path adjacent and the lead reviews
  first.  PR #3752.

## 5. Next Steps & Blockers

- Money-path adjacent: lead runs the adversarial review before arming auto-merge.
- After deploy, watch `audit_events` for `broker_health_probe_process_stalled`,
  `strategy_run_retry_enqueued` / `_skipped` / `_dropped`, and `broker_placement_auto_halted` with
  `probeTimedOut` — the auto-halt count should fall to real three-in-a-row outages.
- Lane A (event-loop stall profiler) owns the stall itself; this lane only stops misattributing it.

## 6. Zero-Code Findings

- The brief's pointer `safety-maintenance.ts:271-317` is actually `broker-health.ts` (the streak
  logic); `safety-maintenance.ts` holds `withLaneDeadline` and the lane ceiling.
- iOS (`ios/SocraticTrade/MobileModels.swift`, `ActivityView.swift`) decodes run status as `String`
  and defaults unknown values to "Completed" — any future new run status needs an iOS release first.
- The web console hides "Stop Agent" while an account is halted, so an owner cannot convert an
  auto-pause to a manual halt from the console; the API and mobile `strategy.stop` can, and now do.

## 7. Review Round (2026-09-25, follow-up PR after #3752 merged)

PR #3752 merged (squash `9152322b4`, 2026-09-25 7:35 PM CT) before the independent review findings
were addressed, so the fixes ship as a follow-up branch `claude/st-run-resilience-followup` off
`origin/main`.  Every finding was verified against the merged code first.  All six were real.

**Fixed.**

1. **P2 — iOS Run once killed by a restart was retried as an autonomous run.**  Verified:
   `mobile-api.ts` `runCommand` calls `runStrategyOnce(userId, { manual: true })` with no
   `strategy_run_requests` row, and eligibility treated "no request row" as "scheduler launched".  A
   killed propose-only run on an `active` account with saved `decide` authority was re-run with
   `manual: false`.  Fix: migration 93 adds `strategy_runs.origin`; `runStrategyOnce` writes it with
   the run row from the same options that decide authority (`resolveStrategyRunOrigin`, new
   `src/lib/strategy-run-origin.ts`: `manual` wins, then `run_state_override`, then `request` when a
   drained `runId` is supplied, else `autonomous`).  Only `autonomous` is retry-eligible; NULL
   (pre-migration rows) fails closed as `unknown_origin`.  No call site changed, so the scheduler,
   trigger, and drain invocations stay byte-identical.
2. **P2 — web Manual Run once swallowed by a queued or running restart retry.**  Verified: the
   dedupe query matched any open request, including `retry_of_run_id` rows.  Fix: retries are never
   dedupe targets; a new owner request drops any still-queued retry with receipt
   `strategy_run_retry_dropped` / `superseded_by_owner_request`; a running retry serializes with the
   owner's run through the per-account strategy run lock, as a scheduler run already does.
3. **P2 — restart retry could run on a draining (disconnected) account.**  Verified:
   `deleteConnectedAccount` sets `is_draining=1, is_active=0` and leaves the strategy state `active`;
   only the scheduler loop skipped draining accounts.  Fix: eligibility (enqueue and drain) reads
   `connected_accounts` and skips `account_missing` / `account_draining`; `runStrategyOnce` also
   refuses any non-manual run on a draining account before broker or LLM work (defense in depth).
4. **P2 — boot marker release lacked `sqliteYieldRetry`.**  Verified: the halted branch of
   `reconcileAutonomyOnBoot` called `releaseBrokerPlacementPauseToOwner` unwrapped, so a
   `SQLITE_BUSY` was swallowed and the stale marker survived to auto-resume the account.  Fix: the
   release is now one IMMEDIATE transaction (read, clear marker and streak, audit), so a busy error
   rolls back the whole unit; the boot call is wrapped in `sqliteYieldRetry`.  Plain wrapping alone
   was not enough: a busy audit after the deletes would have retried into "no marker" and skipped
   the receipt (the second new test proves the rollback).
5. **P2 — the ops-token halt in open PR #3754 bypasses the streak reset.**  Verified in #3754's diff:
   its `halted` branch calls `clearBrokerPlacementPauseMarker` directly.  Fixed from this side, so
   it holds whichever PR lands first and for every re-arm path: `clearBrokerPlacementPauseMarker` now
   also deletes the connectivity streak, and the auto-halt itself resets the streak once it fires, so
   a re-arm (console Start, mobile, ops token) needs a fresh three-in-a-row.  Left for #3754's own
   lane: calling `releaseBrokerPlacementPauseToOwner` there would also write the
   `broker_placement_pause_owner_override` receipt (its `ops_account_control` audit already records
   the action).  #3754's branch was not edited from this lane.
6. **P2 — boot notification misattributed an already-halted account.**  Verified: the halted branch
   pushed into the same `haltedByUser` list whose one body said "reverted from 'active' … because the
   app restarted".  Fix: `reverted` and `autoPauseReleased` are tracked separately; new pure
   `autonomyBootInterlockNotificationCopy` describes each group truthfully (title "Broker auto-pause
   kept after restart: …" when only released).  Payload adds `revertedAccountLabels` and
   `autoPauseReleasedAccountLabels`; `accountLabels` keeps the union.  Same notification type, so the
   owner's `enabledEvents` toggle still applies.

**Declined.**  None.

**Files (review round).**

- `src/lib/strategy-run-origin.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/db.ts` (migration 93 `strategy_runs_origin`)
- `src/lib/db-execution.ts` (`insertStrategyRun` origin parameter)
- `src/lib/strategy.ts` (origin on the run row; draining guard for non-manual runs)
- `src/lib/strategy-run-retry.ts` (origin gate, account missing/draining gate)
- `src/lib/strategy-run-requests.ts` (dedupe excludes retries; owner request supersedes a queued retry)
- `src/lib/broker-health.ts` (streak reset on auto-halt and on marker clear; atomic owner release)
- `src/lib/scheduler.ts` (boot release under `sqliteYieldRetry`; split notification copy)
- `test/strategy-run-restart-retry.test.ts` (7 new cases; setup writes a real connected account and
  an `autonomous` origin)
- `test/strategy-run-origin.test.ts` (new: origin plumbing through the real `runStrategyOnce`,
  draining guard)
- `test/broker-health-probe-resilience.test.ts` (2 new cases; boot-restart case asserts the
  notification)
- `test/scheduler-sqlite-busy.test.ts` (2 new cases: busy marker delete, busy audit rollback)
- `test/scheduler-boot-halt-notify.test.ts` (notification copy case)
- `test/persistence-hardening.test.ts` (schema version 92 -> 93)
- `STATUS.md`, `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`, this note

**Decisions.**

- **Origin derived inside `runStrategyOnce`, not passed by callers.**  The authority decision
  (`manual` -> propose-only) is made there, so recording the origin from the same options cannot
  drift from it, and existing exact-argument tests of the scheduler / trigger / drain calls stay
  valid.
- **Fail closed on NULL origin.**  Runs in flight across the deploy of this follow-up were written
  without an origin and will not be retried once.  One lost retry beats guessing.
- **Migration 93** — no open PR adds a migration (checked `gh pr list` for `src/lib/db.ts`: only
  #3776, no migration).

**Verification (review round).**  Red first: with only the tests applied, the five new
broker-health / boot-busy cases failed for the expected reasons (`expected 3 to be undefined`,
`expected 2 to be undefined`, the "Autonomy halted on boot" title, marker still present, 0 receipts);
the retry-file cases could not load without `strategy-run-origin.ts`.

Green (host load average 250-480, so targeted suites only; the required `verify` check runs the full
suite and build):

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean (before and after merging `origin/main` at `0201b5723`).
- `npx eslint` on every changed file — 0 errors, pre-existing warnings only.
- `npx vitest run test/strategy-run-restart-retry.test.ts test/scheduler-sqlite-busy.test.ts
  test/broker-health-probe-resilience.test.ts test/scheduler-boot-halt-notify.test.ts
  test/strategy-run-origin.test.ts test/persistence-hardening.test.ts` — 75 passed, 2 failed on load
  (the lag-sampler attribution case and the 60s scheduler-tick case, neither touched here); the two
  files rerun alone — 24/24 passed.
- Related suites `broker-health-auto-pause`, `mobile-api`, `route-strategy-pause`,
  `scheduler-followup-lease`, `scheduler-leader-heartbeat`, `stale-running-runs-adoption-grace`,
  `stale-running-runs`, `strategy-run-drain-handoff`, `strategy-run-once-async-route`,
  `strategy-run-status`, `transient-network-resilience` — 11 files, 62 tests passed.

Follow-up PR: #3794 (hold label `do-not-automerge`).
