# Boot script for the PRODUCTION app on the Coolify box (socratictrade.com).
# Coolify start_command runs this script directly; it self-wraps in
# scripts/infisical-run.mjs, so by phase 2 the full Infisical `prod` env
# (app secrets + AWS_*) is present.
#
# Phase 1 (no secrets yet): download pinned litestream + infisical CLI binaries
#   onto the persistent volume (cached across restarts), put them on PATH, then
#   re-exec this script under infisical-run.
# Phase 2 (secrets injected), gated by the DB_BOOTSTRAP runtime env var:
#   fresh (default) - start the app with whatever is in /app/data (empty on the
#                     first boot). An empty DB has no users and no broker
#                     accounts, so the scheduler cannot place orders. Safe to
#                     run while the Mac production process is still live.
#   live            - one-time restore of the production DB from the litestream
#                     R2 replica (guarded by a marker file on the volume), then
#                     run under `litestream replicate -exec` so PITR backup
#                     continuity is preserved. Flip to live ONLY after the Mac
#                     pm2 `trading` + `litestream` processes are stopped --
#                     otherwise two schedulers trade the same broker accounts.

# Pinned BACK from 0.5.14 (2026-07-10): 0.5.14 in this container churned ~20
# sockets/s to the R2 endpoint and held thousands of dead TCP socks (peak 16.8k
# fds on one PID, ~715MB of pinned receive buffers), driving the kernel to
# tcp_mem exhaustion -- every connection's receive window clamped to ~6KB, git
# clones from GitHub trickled at ~20KB/s and died mid-transfer ("TLS unexpected
# eof"), wedging ALL Coolify deploys on the box. All 0.5.x releases read/write
# the same LTX replica format, so moving within 0.5.x is replica-compatible
# (the 0.5.14 restore at cutover read history written by earlier 0.5.x).

# server while the process stays alive.)
# The watchdog below is the missing actor: same /api/live probe, same curl
# flags as the HEALTHCHECK; after LIVENESS_WATCHDOG_FAILURES consecutive
# failures it kills the app process so Docker's restart=unless-stopped

# code -- but an exit 0 is always a lie in a server that must run forever: it
# corrupts forensics and, under any future on-failure-style policy, becomes a
# silent full outage. This supervisor gives every app exit a logged reason and
# translates an unexplained clean exit into a non-zero code:
#   40      = app exited 0 spontaneously (no stop signal forwarded) - always a bug
#   41      = R2 free-tier kill-switch (src/lib/r2-usage.ts); the restart
#             re-boots WITHOUT litestream via the marker branch below
#   42      = R2 replication resume; the restart re-enables litestream
#   43      = in-app exit-guard re-tagged a spontaneous process.exit(0)
#   44      = in-app RSS watchdog pre-OOM exit (src/lib/rss-watchdog.ts);
#             RSS stayed over ST_RSS_LIMIT_MB; the restart is the recovery
#   130/143 = graceful shutdown after a forwarded SIGINT/SIGTERM (docker stop)
# The app is invoked as node_modules/.bin/next directly, NEVER via `npm run`:
# in-container npm dies on SIGTERM without forwarding it to the server (proven
# in the 2026-08-02 sandbox repro), so deploys hard-killed next-server and the
# recorded exit codes were garbage.
# Probes /api/live (same endpoint and curl flags as the Dockerfile
# HEALTHCHECK) in a sequential loop -- one probe at a time, so a wedged server
# can never pile up probes the way the 2026-09-09 zombie-curl incident did.
# Runs as a background subshell of this script, OUTSIDE the Node process, so it
# keeps working when the event loop is fully pinned.
#
# Arming discipline: failures are not counted until the server has answered at
# least once (boot grace) OR the boot grace period expires -- a server that
# cannot serve /api/live LIVENESS_WATCHDOG_BOOT_GRACE_S after process start is
# broken, and one success resets the consecutive-failure count so transient
# stalls (the 40-140s RTH chunks) ride out without a kill.
