# Canonical setup for a fresh, isolated checkout (Claude Code cloud/remote sandbox,
# Codespaces, devcontainer, or any throwaway clone). Idempotent - safe to re-run.
#
# IMPORTANT (Claude Code Cloud environments specifically): the container's working
# directory when the "Setup script" field runs is the PARENT of the cloned repo
# (e.g. /home/user), NOT the repo root - `git clone` creates a `Socratic-Trade/`
# subdirectory and the sandbox drops you one level above it. A bare
# `bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh` therefore fails with
# `bash: scripts/cloud-setup.sh: No such file or directory` (exit 127) because
# that path doesn't resolve from the parent directory.
#
# Point the environment's Setup script field at the fleet locator (works for
# every app; see ai-fleet-coordinator/docs/CLAUDE-CODE-CLOUD-ENVIRONMENTS.md):
#   set -euo pipefail
#   if [ -f scripts/cloud-setup.sh ]; then exec bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh; fi
#   shopt -s nullglob
#   matches=(*/scripts/cloud-setup.sh)
#   if [ "${#matches[@]}" -eq 1 ]; then exec bash "${matches[0]}"; fi
#   echo "ERROR: scripts/cloud-setup.sh not found from $(pwd)" >&2; ls -la >&2; exit 1
#
# Equivalent one-liner if you prefer the repo name:
#   cd Socratic-Trade && bash scripts/cloud-setup.sh
#
# (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`'s `postCreateCommand` does NOT need the `cd`
# - devcontainers set `workspaceFolder` to the repo root automatically. This `cd`
# is only required for the plain Claude Code Cloud "Setup script" text field.)
#
# The app boots keyless: local SQLite at data/app.db is infrastructure (settings,
# proposals, users), not an execution mode. No secrets are required for the UI,
# Market Scan, or watchlist/policy/account configuration. Inject OPENAI_API_KEY
# only if you want the LLM "Run once" / decide loop; placing orders requires a
# connected broker account (paper or live) - there is no local-simulation fallback.
