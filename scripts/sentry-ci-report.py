"""
sentry-ci-report.py — reports CI workflow outcomes to the shared fleet-infra
Sentry project (org jays-services), via raw envelope HTTP (no sentry-sdk
dependency, no GitHub Actions marketplace action).

Invoked by .github/workflows/sentry-ci-report.yml, which listens for
`workflow_run: types: [requested, completed]` across every other workflow in
this repo and sets the env vars this script reads.  This script itself does not
know about GitHub Actions beyond reading those env vars — all the wiring lives
in the workflow file.

Three signals are sent, across the two phases of one observed run:
  1. REQUESTED phase, schedule-triggered runs only (WORKFLOW_RUN_ACTION ==
     "requested"): a Sentry Crons check-in with status "in_progress", which
     OPENS the check-in the moment GitHub creates the run — before a runner is
     even allocated.  No conclusion-based failure event is sent on this path:
     at request time the run's conclusion is still null, so there is nothing
     to alert on there.  A config-drift event CAN still be sent here (the
     unconditional stale-cron-key guard in section 0, or the
     unmapped-schedule event raised by resolve_cron_expr()) if this reporter's
     own CRON_SCHEDULES mapping has fallen out of date.  Before sending the
     in_progress check-in, this phase also asks the Actions API whether the
     observed run has already finished (fetch_observed_run_status()) and
     skips the check-in if so.  GitHub's own concurrency group does not
     GUARANTEE that this requested-phase reporter run is created before the
     completed-phase one — a very fast observed run can flip that order — so
     this check is what actually keeps the two reporter runs from racing to
     open a check-in the completed phase has already closed.
  2. COMPLETED phase, if the run's conclusion warrants an alert (failure /
     timed_out / startup_failure — see ALERT_CONCLUSIONS): a Sentry error event
     tagged with {app, workflow, branch, actor}, carrying the run URL,
     fingerprinted on [ci-failure, app, workflow] so every failure of one
     workflow groups into ONE Sentry issue instead of paging separately every
     time.
  3. COMPLETED phase, if the run was schedule-triggered (event == "schedule"):
     the terminal Sentry Crons check-in (status "error" when the conclusion is
     in ALERT_CONCLUSIONS, "ok" for every other conclusion — the monitor
     answers "did this cron fire", and a cancelled/skipped tick is not a
     failure of the schedule) with an upsert monitor_config whose schedule
     mirrors that workflow's own cron expression (see CRON_SCHEDULES below) so a
     nightly/weekly job that silently STOPS running raises a missed-check-in
     alert.  It carries the SAME check_in_id as (1), which is what CLOSES the
     in_progress check-in that phase opened.

The two phases are two separate GitHub jobs with no shared state, so the
check_in_id cannot simply be generated once and passed along: both phases
DERIVE it from the observed run, via checkin_id_for_run() (a uuid5 over the
app, the observed run id, and the run attempt).  Sentry closes an in_progress
check-in only when a terminal check-in arrives bearing the same id, so that
determinism is the whole mechanism.  See FLEET-INFRA-CB / board c630ceed for
why the in_progress phase exists at all: without it, checkin_margin had to
absorb the observed job runtime as well as GitHub's schedule-dispatch delay.

The branch is deliberately NOT part of the fingerprint (it was until
2026-08-12).  Branch names are unbounded and short-lived, so including one
minted a brand-new, permanent Sentry issue for every (workflow, branch) pair —
~85 of this fleet's 200+ unresolved fleet-infra issues came from that single
line, each one a dead feature branch nobody will ever look at again.  The
branch is still carried as a per-event TAG (searchable, and visible on every
event), which is where unbounded-cardinality data belongs.

The `app` tag + fingerprint component are required: fleet-infra is shared
across repos, and this repo shares workflow names ("CI", "Security",
"Effort Issues Sync") with Socratic.Trade / Congress.Trade, so without `app`
a "CI" failure here would dedup into the same Sentry issue as one there.
Per AGENT-SYNC.md "Observability", every event is tagged with `app:<repo>`.

Secrets: SENTRY_FLEET_DSN is read only from the environment (set by the
workflow from the repo secret) and is NEVER printed or logged in any form,
including in exception messages.
