#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/merge-shepherd.sh
#
# Drives auto-merge-armed PRs home and reports the state of EVERY open PR, so
# background work can't silently rot into CONFLICTING and be forgotten.
#
# It only *acts* (merge / update-branch / re-run verify) on PRs whose author
# already ARMED auto-merge (i.e. it went through scripts/land.sh). Everything
# else it only *reports* -- it never force-merges work nobody opted in to land.
#
# Why this is needed: the handoff protocol makes every PR edit docs/EFFORT-LOG.md
# + STATUS.md, so each merge turns every other open PR CONFLICTING. GitHub's
# native auto-merge can't self-heal that; land.sh arms auto-merge once and never
# comes back. This shepherd is the "come back": union-merge (.gitattributes) makes
# those board conflicts vanish on update-branch, and the shepherd re-syncs stuck
# PRs, re-runs flaky verify once, merges the green ones, and publishes a digest.
#
# Design notes:
# - GitHub reports PR mergeability lazily (often "UNKNOWN"), so we don't trust it;
#   we *attempt* the merge and react to the outcome -- the attempt forces the
#   computation and tells us whether it's really a conflict.
# - The only merge gate is the required `verify` check (ruleset: no approvals, not
#   strict, no thread-resolution), so `verify == SUCCESS` is our green signal.
#
# Env:
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY   owner/repo (default: gh repo view, else Simple-With-Us/Socratic-Trade)
#   SHEPHERD_DRY_RUN=1  report only; attempt nothing
#   GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN  auth. A PAT (repo+workflow scope) is preferred so that
#                          update-branch re-triggers verify; the default Actions
#                          GITHUB_TOKEN still merges green PRs + reports.
#   SHEPHERD_HAS_PAT       set to "0" by merge-shepherd.yml when no SHEPHERD_TOKEN
#                          secret exists, so update-branch re-syncs are skipped
#                          (report-only) instead of attempted with a token that
#                          can't re-trigger verify. Unset (e.g. the launchd driver,
#                          which uses a real user PAT) defaults to "1".
