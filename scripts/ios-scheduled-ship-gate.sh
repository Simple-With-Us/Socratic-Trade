# ios-scheduled-ship-gate.sh - Decide whether a SCHEDULED ios-ship run ships.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# .github/workflows/ios-ship.yml carries a `schedule:` trigger because a PR
# merged by github-actions[bot] lands on main under GitHub's recursion guard
# and dispatches no workflow run at all -- so `push:` alone could not be
# trusted to notice that iOS code had landed. Measured here 2026-08-13: PR
# #2675 (bot-merged, sha ca38bb2979) has 27 workflow runs on that sha and ZERO
# are `event: push`, while PR #2680 (human-merged) got the full set.
#
# But a cron carries no `paths:` filter, and ship-testflight.sh's own gate only
# tests "is HEAD the sha I last shipped" plus a time interval -- neither of
# which knows whether ios/ changed. THIS REPO ALREADY PAID FOR THAT GAP: run
# 31723515355 (event=schedule, 2026-08-13T17:00Z) logged "ship-gate: ok" and
# then "archiving..." for sha 39c6acee, which is
#   fix(alerts): stop RH MCP schema 400s, Pinecone 40960 overflow, ...
# -- eight files, not one of them under ios/. That build went to testers as a
# byte-identical app with a new build number. Socratic-Trade has the fleet's
# highest commit volume, so the unguarded '*/30' cron was the fleet's biggest
# TestFlight-spam source, not an edge case.
#
# The owner does not want TestFlight spammed, so the scheduled path ships only
# when one of the workflow's push paths (the app's own source tree or the ship
# tooling) actually changed since its last successful ship. Push and
# workflow_dispatch bypass this entirely: a push already passed the workflow's
# `paths:` filter, and a dispatch is an explicit instruction.
#
# Usage:
#   ios-scheduled-ship-gate.sh --path-prefix <pattern> [options] <key> [key...]
#   (this repo ships one app: `socratic`; the workflow passes its whole
#   on.push.paths list, one --path-prefix per entry, so a missed push still
#   ships exactly what the push trigger would have shipped)
#
# Options:
#   --path-prefix P   Repo-relative push-path pattern that counts as a ship
#                     reason (required, repeatable; e.g. ios/ or ios/**, an
#                     exact file, or '!dir/' to exclude). A trailing "/**" is
#                     a subtree; a leading "!" excludes, as in on.push.paths.
#                     A lone single --path-prefix call keeps working as before.
#   --event NAME      GitHub event name (default: $GITHUB_EVENT_NAME).
#                     Anything other than "schedule" votes ship=1 for every
#                     app: a push already passed the workflow's paths filter,
#                     and a manual dispatch is an explicit instruction.
#   --repo-root PATH  Repo to inspect (default: cwd)
#   --state-dir PATH  Where ship-testflight.sh records successful ships
#                     (default: $IOS_FLEET_STATE_DIR, else ~/.cache/ios-fleet)
#
# Output:
#   Human-readable reasoning on stdout, plus, when $GITHUB_OUTPUT is set:
#     should_ship=0|1        1 if ANY listed app should ship
#     ship_<app_key>=0|1     per app, with '-' in the key replaced by '_'
#
# Exit code is always 0 on a decision. Deciding "skip" is a normal outcome and
# must never turn a scheduled tick red.
#
# ASCII-only (Apple bash 3.2 safe), matches ship-testflight.sh conventions.
