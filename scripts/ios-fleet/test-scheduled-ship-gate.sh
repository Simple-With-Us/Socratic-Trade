# test-scheduled-ship-gate.sh - Offline tests for scheduled-ship-gate.sh.
#
# The gate is the only thing standing between a half-hourly cron and a
# TestFlight build for every backend commit. It runs exclusively on the owned
# Mac runner, so without these tests a defect in it is invisible until either
# testers get spammed or an iOS change silently never ships. Everything here is
# a throwaway git repo in a scratch dir: no network, no credentials, no
# xcodebuild, no App Store Connect.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ios-fleet/test-scheduled-ship-gate.sh
#
# ASCII-only (Apple bash 3.2 safe).
