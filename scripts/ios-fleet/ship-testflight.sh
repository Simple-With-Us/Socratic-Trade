# Options:
#   --repo-root PATH   Repo root (default: cwd)
#   --build N          Force CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION (default: UTC YYYYMMDDHHMM)
#   --version X.Y.Z    Force MARKETING_VERSION (optional)
#   --export-only      Build IPA only; do not upload
#   --upload-only IPA  Skip archive; upload an existing IPA via ASC API key
#   --dry-run          Print plan and exit
#   --skip-xcodegen    Do not regenerate .xcodeproj
#   --allow-dirty      Allow shipping from a dirty git worktree
#   --force-ship       Bypass min-interval + same-HEAD skip (emergency / owner)
#   --sync-project-version  Write the resolved version into project.pbxproj
#   --allow-unverified-seq  Ship even if App Store Connect cannot be consulted
#                           AND no local/project sequence exists (dangerous:

#
# Version numbering (owner directive 2026-08-12, revised same day):
#   MARKETING_VERSION       = 1.0.<seq>          +1 on EVERY rebuild
#   CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = <UTC YYYYMMDDHHMM> when the build was cut
# App Store Connect renders "<marketing> (<build>)", so a ship shows
# "1.0.8 (202609012215)". Marketing +1 every rebuild; build is the cut time.
# The sequence is max(local cache, App Store Connect, project.pbxproj) + 1, so a
# lost or reset local counter cannot silently reuse a shipped version.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS HOLDING BACK AUTOMATIC SHIPPING: THE MIN-INTERVAL RATE LIMIT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Applies to uploads only (--export-only and --dry-run are free):
#   DEFAULT MINIMUM INTERVAL BETWEEN SUCCESSFUL TESTFLIGHT SHIPS, PER APP:
#       DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=3600  (3600 seconds = 1 hour)
#   That constant is defined a few dozen lines below and is the main reason a
#   merge to main does not become a TestFlight build. .github/workflows/
#   ios-ship.yml fires on every push to main touching clients/ios/**, and this
#   gate turns most of those runs into a no-op skip (exit 0).
#   Override for one run:  IOS_TF_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC=7200 (2h)  or  --force-ship
#   Change the default:    edit DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC below (owner's call).
#
#   Also skips when git HEAD matches the last successful ship (no new commits).
#   Skip exits 0 ("nothing to do") so agent loops stay quiet, and a skipped run
#   does NOT consume a build sequence number (see the ship-gate ordering note
#   at the call site).
#   State: ~/.cache/ios-fleet/last-ship-<app>.txt  (unix_ts + space + git_sha)
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POST-UPLOAD: ensure-tf-ready AND TESTFLIGHT RELEASE NOTES (2026-08-13)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ensure_tf_ready now passes BUILD_NUM (CFBundleVersion) to asc-api.mjs, which
# polls App Store Connect until THAT EXACT BUILD appears and only then declares
# export compliance on it. Before this it took "the newest build", which for the
# first minutes after an upload is the PREVIOUS ship -- so compliance was
# declared on the wrong build and the "testers can install this" line described
# a build it had never looked at.
#   IOS_TF_READY_TIMEOUT_SEC   discovery + readiness budget (default 900s)
#   exit 4 from asc-api.mjs    uploaded build never surfaced; warn, do NOT fail
#                              (record_successful_ship must still run or the rate
#                              gate never advances)
#
# It also renders the mandatory AGENT-SYNC "What to Test" release note from the
# commit range since the last successful ship. THIS IS OPT-IN, because it writes
# copy every TestFlight tester reads:
#   IOS_TF_RELEASE_NOTES=1     publish to App Store Connect
#   IOS_TF_RELEASE_NOTES=0     off entirely
#   unset (DEFAULT)            dry render into the ship log; nothing is written
#   IOS_TF_RELEASE_TITLE=...   override the "<App> Update" title
# CI needs `fetch-depth: 0` on actions/checkout or the runner workspace holds a
# single commit and the range is uncomputable (verified 2026-08-13 on all three
# fleet runners).
#
# Secrets (never printed):

#   SENTRY_DSN         (injected into xcodebuild so Cocoa plist $(SENTRY_DSN) is set)

# Owner directive: version naming is 1.0.# (timestamp).
# EVERY rebuild — including a tiny tweak — adds exactly 1 to the last number.
# MARKETING_VERSION (CFBundleShortVersionString) is 1.0.<seq>.
# CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION (CFBundleVersion) is a UTC timestamp YYYYMMDDHHMM.
# ASC shows "1.0.8 (202608121315)".
#
# Apple requires CFBundleVersion to be strictly increasing WITHIN a marketing
# train, and trade.congress.ios has builds numbered 202608070253 through
# 202608120521 sitting in the 1.0.0 train.
#
# So CFBundleVersion is a UTC timestamp, YYYYMMDDHHMM:
#   - the parenthetical says WHEN the build was cut, which is the useful
#     information the owner asked for: "1.0.8 (202608121315)"
#   - it is monotonic by construction, so it can never regress
#   - it is greater than every existing timestamp build, so it stays legal even
#     if a ship ever lands back in an older train
#   - it is demonstrably a legal CFBundleVersion for ASC: those builds
#     were all accepted in exactly this format
# Collisions are not a concern: two ships in the same UTC minute would need to
# beat both the archive lock and the 1h min interval, and they would carry
# different marketing versions anyway (Apple's uniqueness is per version+build).
#
# Sequence state: ${STATE_DIR}/build-seq-<app>.txt (atomic-mkdir-guarded).
# NOTE: flock(1) does not exist on macOS — under `set -e` a flock call would
# kill the subshell and yield an EMPTY sequence ("1.0."), so the mutex is an
# atomic mkdir instead (portable to Apple bash 3.2, per the header contract).
#
# That local file is a CACHE, not the source of truth. It is one unbacked file
# on one machine: if it is lost, reset, or a ship runs from a second machine,
# a bare "+1" reuses a build number and App Store Connect rejects the upload as
# a duplicate. So the next sequence is
#     max(local cache, App Store Connect, project.pbxproj) + 1
# which is monotonic against every record we have. Taking the max can skip a
# number (harmless — numbers are free); reusing one is fatal.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ordering matters and used to be wrong. The gate was evaluated ~60 lines below
# the point where next_build_seq() commits floor+1 to the counter, so every
# rate-limited attempt burned a version that never shipped (observed live
# 2026-08-12: skipped at 4392s of a 9000s interval, sequence still went 5 -> 6).
#
# Everything the gate needs is already resolved above: APP_KEY, REPO_ROOT (for
# HEAD), EXPORT_ONLY, FORCE_SHIP, STATE_DIR. Nothing between here and the old
# call site set up anything it reads, so moving it earlier drops no step. What
# it now runs BEFORE is: PBXPROJ resolution, resolve_seq_floor (an App Store
# Connect round trip), next_build_seq (the consuming step), the project-version
# agreement check, --sync-project-version, load_secrets, and the output dirs.
# The dirty-worktree check stays ahead of the gate so a dirty tree still fails
# loudly rather than being masked by a quiet rate-limit skip.
#
# --force-ship and --export-only still bypass the gate exactly as before, and
# --dry-run still reports the gate outcome alongside the version plan (it peeks
# at the sequence without consuming it, so evaluating early changes nothing for
# it beyond ordering the log lines).
