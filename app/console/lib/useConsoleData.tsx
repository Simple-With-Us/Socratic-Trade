// `error`, and it must never flip the shell to the error card.
//
// It used to do exactly that (set `error` at 15s), and that was a real bug the owner hit on every
// single production load: getDashboardSnapshot is self-bounded but its broker chain is SEQUENTIAL
// (~24s worst case — see FETCH_DEADLINE_MS below), so any first load in the 15-24s band showed
// "Couldn't load the autonomy desk" while the request was still in flight and about to succeed.
// The native iOS client, which polls the SAME getDashboardSnapshot via /api/mobile/snapshot but
// just waits out its 30s URLSession timeout, loaded fine at the same moment — that split is what
// the owner reported ("iOS said stale for a few minutes, then Updated; the website errors").
//
// The watchdog's original job — "don't sit on the logo forever if the fetch hangs" — is now owned
// by FETCH_DEADLINE_MS, which aborts and retries a genuinely hung attempt. So this timer no longer
// needs to (and must not) manufacture an error to stay safe.

// built-in timeout, so a request that hangs at the network layer (an open connection that never
// receives data — exactly the kernel TCP-memory-exhaustion failure mode that caused the prod
// incident this file's coalescing logic exists to fix) would otherwise sit in `inFlight` forever:
// every later SSE/poll/visibility trigger only sets `pendingBackgroundRefresh` and returns (by
// design, to avoid resurrecting the old abort-storm), so nothing would ever start a fresh attempt.
// This timer fires ONCE per attempt (not once per event), so it cannot reintroduce that storm — it
// only kills an attempt that has been stuck well past what any real (even fully degraded) response
// should take.
//
// This ceiling MUST sit above the server's own worst-case self-bounded response. getDashboardSnapshot
// races each upstream against its own deadline, but the broker chain is SEQUENTIAL — gateway.getAccounts
// (6s) → portfolio/positions/orders (8s) → getEquityQuotes (6s) = 20s — and computeSpyBenchmark (4s) runs
// after it, so a slow-but-not-hung account with held symbols can legitimately take ~24s to return a fully
// degraded snapshot. A client ceiling at/below that would abort right as the server is about to respond,
// retry, and keep the console stuck on the watchdog/retry path even though the server deadlines are
// working as designed. 35s leaves headroom over that 24s server bound (plus sync DB work) while still
// killing a genuine network hang, which never resolves at all.
