// Rich public/ops probe — NOT the Coolify/Traefik backend probe.  Docker HEALTHCHECK
// and any Coolify HTTP health path must use GET /api/live.  A 503 here (critical
// Pinecone/RAG/Alpaca hard-stop) or a >5s response used to mark the named container
// running:unhealthy while Next was up; Traefik then had no healthy backend
// (2026-08-17 7:22-7:43pm CT after #2810).  UptimeRobot may still alert on this
// route.  This probes:
//   - DB reachability (the getInternalSetting read throws if SQLite is unwritable/locked), and
//   - scheduler liveness (age of the last tick heartbeat; stale ⇒ autonomy/stops aren't running).
// Returns 503 when a critical check fails so PM2/uptime tooling can act.
//
// TWO AUDIENCES. This route is in middleware's PUBLIC_PREFIXES, so everything it emits is
// world-readable — correct for the external uptime monitor that polls it and for the
// credential-less deploy-verify runbook (.claude/skills/deploy-verify/SKILL.md greps
// `.checks.db`, `.checks.schedulerAgeSeconds`, `.checks.storage.litestream*`). Three items are
// operator-only and are therefore gated on the SAME token as /api/ops/snapshot (`x-ops-token`,
// ops-auth.ts) rather than a second auth scheme:
//   - the OpenRouter prepaid balance in USD — publishing "the LLM budget is nearly exhausted"
//     hands an anonymous caller a precisely-timed, cheap window to drain what is (post-#1703
//     universal routing) the single point of failure for every LLM call and all RAG embedding,
//   - the host disk / SQLite byte counts — free capacity reconnaissance, and
//   - the raw scheduler-lease owner, which carries this container's OS pid.
// Gating is a PROJECTION only: `ok`, the 200/503 status, and every degraded flag are computed from
// the same values either way and are byte-identical between the two views. Do not fold any of this
// into the status logic — a spurious 503 restarts the container, which re-halts autonomy via the
// boot interlock (see the trading-liveness note below).
//
// Failure mode worth knowing: authorizeOpsRequest fails closed on an UNCONFIGURED secret — with
// OPS_DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN unset it returns false for everyone, quietly, so the operator sees the
// public view too.  ADMIN_REINDEX_TOKEN is not a fallback.  That is the same condition that
// already makes /api/ops/snapshot unusable, so it is a token-provisioning problem, not a
// health-route one; the full lease owner is still on /api/ready (session-gated, no ops token
// needed) either way.
//
// External paging: HTTP 200/503 is liveness only (DB + pinecone / alpaca-broker hard-stops).
// schedulerStale, tradingLiveness.degraded, and storage.litestreamTiersDegraded are JSON flags
// that MUST stay 200 so a Coolify restart cannot "heal" them.  Page those with keyword/JSON
// monitors — see docs/runbooks/uptime-health-json-monitors.md.
