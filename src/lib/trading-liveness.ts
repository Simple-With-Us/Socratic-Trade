// Handoff 6b.7: the scheduler heartbeat (/api/health's schedulerAgeSeconds) only proves the tick
// FUNCTION is running — it goes green the instant a DB write succeeds, even if every strategy run
// it kicks off then fails (persistent LLM/broker outage). This module adds a second, orthogonal
// signal: per active-autonomy account, how long since a run actually COMPLETED, and how many runs
// in a row have failed. Read-only; never throws (callers treat a thrown/failed computation the
// same as "no data" rather than letting it break the health probe).
//
// Deliberately NEVER maps to a 503 anywhere it's consumed — see the /api/health call site. A
// container restart re-triggers the boot autonomy interlock (reconcileAutonomyOnBoot), reverting
// every "active" account to "halted" (6b.1) — so a naive 503-on-stale-runs would have Coolify
// restart the very process needed to place the trade that clears the staleness, and instead HALT
// autonomy. This is `degraded`-only signal for a human/alert to act on.
//
// Market-session-aware staleness (audit finding, 2026-07-15): the scheduler deliberately skips
// runs while the market is closed (strategy.ts's "Market is closed" guard, sourced from
// market-calendar.ts's isMarketOpen — the SAME source of truth reused here), so a naive
// age-vs-threshold comparison reports every account "stale" as its overnight/weekend baseline.
// The rule: the `stale_last_completed_run` reason can only fire when the market is OPEN at
// evaluation time (`isMarketOpen(now)`). A stale run while the market is closed still reports its
// real age (never fabricated/hidden) plus `marketOpen: false`, just without flipping `degraded`.
// This is the simplest honest rule — it does not try to reconstruct "was the market open at any
// point since the last completed run"; it only asks "is staleness actionable right now." The
// `consecutive_failures` reason is unaffected: a run only reaches 'failed' status by actually
// executing, which itself only happens while the market is open (or extended hours, per
// policy.runDuringExtendedHours), so that signal is already implicitly market-gated.
