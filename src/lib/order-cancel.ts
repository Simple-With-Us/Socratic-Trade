/**
 * THE cancel path. Extracted verbatim from app/api/orders/cancel/route.ts so the web console, the
 * mobile command lane, and any future caller share ONE implementation — a second cancel written
 * against the gateway directly would drift from the lease receipt, the dust advisory, the audit
 * trail, and the dashboard event that this one carries.
 *
 * Doctrine preserved from the route (do not "improve" these away):
 * - A standalone cancel NEVER waits on the account mutation lease. It can only free buying power,
 *   so it proceeds through someone else's window and receipts the interleave instead.
 * - The pre-cancel broker read is ADVISORY and time-bounded. A hung or failing read must never
 *   delay or block the cancel itself.
 * - `dustWarning` never gates the cancel; it is attached to the result after the fact.
