/**
 * Classifies WHY a resting broker order exists, so the ops snapshot and the console Orders
 * screen can say more than "open order" — the concrete owner report this exists for: four
 * resting Alpaca-paper orders (BAC, BRK-B, KO, PYPL) turned out to be correct, app-placed
 * protective stops (`broker_protective_stops`, status "resting"), but nothing in the ops
 * snapshot or the UI said so.
 *
 * PURE MODULE — zero DB/server imports, safe for a "use client" component (app/console/orders/
 * page.tsx) to import directly for `ORDER_ROLE_LABELS` / `type OrderRole`. `classifyOrderRole`
 * only classifies over facts already fetched onto an order (state, side, type, price levels,
 * `ctx`) — it never touches the database itself.
 *
 * The DB-backed half — `loadOrderRoleContexts` (reuses `order-provenance.ts`'s
 * `isAppPlacedBrokerOrder`; see that file for why a nonempty broker `client_order_id` alone is
 * never enough), `attachOrderRoles`, and `buildOpsWorkingOrderDetails` — lives in the
 * server-only sibling module `order-role-context.ts`. That split exists because this file used
 * to import `getDb` (`./db`) and `order-provenance.ts` directly: both pull in `"server-only"`
 * transitively, so `app/console/orders/page.tsx` (a client component) importing `ORDER_ROLE_
 * LABELS` from here dragged the whole DB layer into the client bundle and broke `next build`
 * ("You're importing a module that depends on 'server-only'"). `order-role-context.ts` is the
 * one-call convenience both `dashboard.ts` (console Orders screen) and `ops-snapshot.ts`
 * (`ordersDetail=1`) use so the two surfaces can never classify the same order two different
 * ways — see that file for `attachOrderRoles`/`buildOpsWorkingOrderDetails`.

 *      be mislabeled. Narrower in practice (the strategy prompt requires every short to carry a
 *      bracketStopLoss, which routes most shorts through the bracket path above instead), but a
 *      known residual gap — see the rollout note.
