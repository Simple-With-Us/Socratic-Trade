// sec-ingest-seeder.ts — turns the frozen SEC/RAG universe manifest into SecIngestWorker jobs/tasks.
//
// This is the "discovery" stage the checkpoint state machine itself does not do: SecIngestWorker's
// tasks start life already at checkpoint 'discovered' (see enqueueSecIngestTask in db-rag-ingest.ts)
// and its first checkpoint ('discovered' -> 'fetched') only FETCHES a document whose accession/url is
// already known. Something has to translate "issuer N in the manifest" into "these accessions, these
// primary-document URLs" — that's this module, via fetchRecentFilings (EDGAR submissions API).
//
// Baseline scope per issuer (2026-09-27 v2 "breadth"): the latest 10-K, latest 4 10-Qs, 2 8-Ks,
// 1 DEF 14A, 1 S-1 and 2 ownership forms, plus up to 2 material exhibits per 8-K/10-K accession
// (SEC_INGEST_BASELINE_FORM_LIMITS / SEC_INGEST_BASELINE_EXHIBIT_LIMIT below). One task per
// document, sequence=1 — documentName keeps the worker's (accession, sequence, documentName) key
// unique when one accession contributes more than one document.
//
// IDEMPOTENCY: one job per issuer per (corpusRevision, manifest snapshotId). The job's
// idempotencyKey is buildSecIngestJobKey({corpusRevision, universeSnapshotId, scope: {cik}}) — a
// stable natural key already enforced UNIQUE at the DB layer (sec_ingest_jobs.idempotency_key), so
// createSecIngestJob is a safe no-op replay. Each task's key is similarly derived from
// (accession, sequence, documentName) and enforced UNIQUE per job — re-seeding never duplicates rows.
//
// DEAD-LETTER DISCIPLINE: once a job's intake is sealed (sealSecIngestJobIntake), enqueueSecIngestTask
// refuses to add more tasks to it — by construction, a sealed job can never be re-driven by a later
// seed call. This function treats "intake already closed" as the sole re-seed guard: it skips
// re-fetching EDGAR and re-enqueuing entirely for that issuer, whether the job finished (complete),
// finished with permanently dead-lettered documents (complete_with_errors), or is still actively
// working through its already-sealed task list (running). A genuinely new attempt (e.g. after a
// parser fix) requires a new corpusRevision or manifest snapshotId — a new natural key, not a mutation
// of the old job. This is the guard against the non-terminating backfill loop that burned a sister
// app $1,153: nothing here ever retries a dead-lettered document automatically.
