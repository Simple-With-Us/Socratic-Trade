# Active Implementation Plan

> **2026-07-26 — Free-first enrichment cascade + coverage report (CURSOR).** Prefer
> free/keyless + RapidAPI failover before paid native keys; coverage Admin/ops. Follow-up:
> FilingAPI.dev, SEC XBRL default ON, RapidAPI yh-finance / real-time-finance-data /
> seeking-alpha (pricing-page Subscribe links in rollout). Branch
> `cursor/free-cascade-coverage-0aef`. Rollout:
> `docs/rollouts/2026-07-26-free-cascade-coverage.md`.
> **2026-07-27 — Dormant features readiness (CURSOR).** Substrate so remaining default-off
> capabilities can be enabled safely: `dormantFeatures` checklist on `/api/admin/rag-coverage`,
> `LANDING_PAGE_ENABLED` unset=ON with explicit off-switch, CSP report-uri collector, and
> `VECTOR_EMBED_CLEAN_TEXT` bumping `embed_rev` 1→2. Do **not** flip MULTIQUERY/HyDE, ASOF_STRICT,
> FMP dual-gate, SEC8K full body, or legacy purge without owner preconditions. Branch
> `cursor/dormant-features-impl-1c6c`. Checklist: `docs/FEATURE-ENABLEMENT-BACKLOG.md`.
> **2026-07-25 — Fix vs-SPY benchmark (CURSOR).** Correct cash-flow-aware TWR vs SPY so all-cash
> deposits/resets are not alpha and Home shows You / SPY decomposition. Branch
> `cursor/fix-vs-spy-benchmark-9833`. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-25-fix-vs-spy-benchmark.md`.
> **2026-07-22 — PR #1792 typecheck repair (CODEX).** The provider-generic health-lane merge
> resolution is now aligned with the current durable dispatch API in `28a09b84`; run hosted
> verification, let auto-merge land it, and confirm the exact post-merge deployment receipt.
> **2026-07-24 - RAG enablement + Exit Contract B1 + prune (CURSOR).** Safe RAG flags default ON
> (`docs/FEATURE-ENABLEMENT-BACKLOG.md`). Exit Phase B: B1 substrate landed; B3 interim already on
> main (#1786); B4–B6 + Phase C remain Planned. Wave-2 coaching/reflection DISCARD (branches
> deleted). Stale no-PR origin tips pruned (19). Next: Infisical mirror if desired; Exit B4 before
> live shorts; full verify gate on PR.

> **2026-07-24 - Effort-board accuracy audit (CURSOR).** Cleared empty In Progress; corrected
> Planned/Completed status claims against merged PRs. Active product backlog remains: RAG/feature
> enablement (`docs/FEATURE-ENABLEMENT-BACKLOG.md`), Exit-strategy Phases B/C, and remaining
> activity-audit P2 items that are still unmerged. Stale w2 coaching/reflection branches still exist
> on origin without PRs if someone wants to land them.


> **2026-07-22 — Approval Busy/red-team/UptimeRobot repair (CODEX, branch
> `codex/trade-approval-redteam-uptime-20260722`).** Keep the per-account strategy lock as the
> correctness fence, but retry its side-effect-free Busy response in the approval client so a user
> does not have to race a long LLM run. Use OpenRouter's account-filtered model list before choosing
> rotation slots; explicit unavailable model selections remain fail-closed and require owner choice.
> Keep the external monitor on public `/api/health`; do not expose authenticated `/api/ready` just for
> monitoring. Verify the dedicated branch with the ordered lint/tsc/test/build gate, then land via
> `scripts/land.sh` if the owner wants deployment.
> **2026-07-24 - Resolve open efforts + stale issue mirrors (CURSOR).** Board hygiene moves
> already-merged In Progress rows to Completed; restores ruleset `check-pin` required alongside
> `verify`; drains Sentry CI spam blocking runners. Four open PRs still await `verify`. RAG
> enablement remains Planned (re-embed proof). Rollout:
> `docs/rollouts/2026-07-24-resolve-open-efforts.md`.

> **2026-07-22 — PR #1792 typecheck repair (CODEX).** The provider-generic health-lane merge
> resolution is now aligned with the current durable dispatch API in `28a09b84`; run hosted
> verification, let auto-merge land it, and confirm the exact post-merge deployment receipt.
> **2026-07-23 - Unstick remaining open PRs (CURSOR).** Five open PRs (#1901/#1902/#1792/#1819/#1842)
> refreshed onto current `main`, conflict-resolved where real, auto-merge armed. Effort board
> corrected for already-merged rows (#1892 and related). Next: wait hosted verify → auto-merge;
> then RAG enablement remains Planned (telemetry/eval before `RAG_CORPUS_WIDE_LEXICAL`).
> **2026-07-24 - Unstick remaining open PRs round 2 (CURSOR).** Four open PRs
> (#1902/#1792/#1819/#1842) rebased onto current `main` after peer force-pushes; CI/merge fixes
> pushed; auto-merge armed. #1901/#1980/#1981 already on `main`. Effort-board stale In Progress
> rows corrected (#1847/#1828/#1839/#1981/check-pin/which-key/retired-provider). Next: hosted
> `verify` green → auto-merge; RAG enablement remains Planned.

> **2026-07-22 — Retired-provider Usage Monitor cleanup — COMPLETED via #1901 (CURSOR note).**
> Broker runtime retained; Usage Monitor emissions for retired broker families removed.
> **2026-07-22 - RAG review remediation follow-up (CODEX).** PR #1892's latest review pass found
> five correctness gaps. Keep local FTS recall active when paid rerank/hybrid budget degradation
> trips; classify source-backed 8-K rows without a `sec_filings` join; include immutable occurrence
> coordinates in chat evidence refs; require vector IDs or accession coordinates in golden selectors;
> and allocate identical serialized evidence to one occurrence. Verify focused tests, TypeScript,
> lint, then the full required gate before pushing the existing PR ref.

> **2026-07-21 - RAG strategic-performance implementation (CODEX team).** Execute in ordered,
> isolated PRs: (1) repair the managed-ingestion stale Voyage prerequisite and add a production-mode
> OpenRouter regression; (2) add a production-path point-in-time financial retrieval evaluator; (3)
> add a pure corpus-wide FTS5 candidate source; (4) integrate dense+lexical union before exactly one
> rerank, using the new decoupled/default-off adaptive rerank policy and typed stage telemetry; (5)
> align evidence manifests with exact prompt consumption and add declared-use evidence receipts;
> (6) certify counts and evaluation gates before any legacy purge or model/infrastructure change.
> Rerank policy + telemetry modules are locally green on `codex/rag-strategy-program-20260721`;
> ingestion, evaluator, and lexical modules are active parallel lanes. Production re-embed remains
> externally owned; CODEX will not launch competing corpus writes.
> **2026-07-22 integration update:** Steps 1-6 are implemented on the current-main integration tree:
> provider-aware managed ingestion, strict production-path/PIT evaluation, committed/current
> tenant-safe corpus-wide FTS recall, one-pass dense+lexical fusion, independently routed/default-off
> adaptive reranking, stage telemetry, exact consumption, structured/narrative routing, bounded parent
> context, Pinecone hosted-inference comparison, and Turso/Assistant capability probes. Independent
> review findings are remediated, and the final ordered local gate is green: lint (0 errors / 615
> warnings), TypeScript, 434 files / 5,015 tests, and production build. Current-main Node 24 landing
> verification passes TypeScript, 439 files / 5,027 tests, and production build; ready PR #1892 is
> open. Remaining: required hosted checks, merge/auto-deploy receipt, and live exact-SHA verification.
> Production activation stays off.
> **2026-07-22 PR review update:** Centralize immutable id-less evidence identity so prompt
> consumption and Socratic attribution use identical accession/section/ordinal/content/namespace/
> tenant coordinates. Focused tests, TypeScript, scoped lint, and the final Node 24 ordered gate are
> green (lint 0 errors / 613 warnings, TypeScript, 439 files / 5,028 tests, production build); push
> the remediation to PR #1892 and resolve its review thread. Follow-up review now moves lexical
> metadata predicates ahead of the bounded FTS cap, matches filing text only, and separates the
> credentialed retrieval user from the generated isolated evaluation run id; rerun focused checks,
> push, and resolve all three new review threads.
> **2026-07-21 — Managed RAG ingestion authority repair (CODEX, branch `codex/rag-ingestion-gate-20260721`).**
> Repair the stale `storeDocument` provider gate left by the Voyage SDK purge: require Pinecone
> initialization plus the actual active embedding provider credential, while preserving the explicit
> test-only Voyage path. Add a production-mode OpenRouter/Pinecone regression. This is a code-path
> prerequisite only; no re-embed, purge, secret, or production operation is included.
> **2026-07-22 — RAG Turso/libSQL + Pinecone Assistant shadow benchmarks (CODEX, branch `codex/rag-shadow-benchmarks-20260722`).** Land the default-off read-only harness only after focused test/lint/TypeScript checks. Do not add a libSQL runtime dependency or route production retrieval to Turso until an explicit shadow comparison has a configured remote target and measured recall/latency/cost receipt. Pinecone Assistant remains a pre-existing-assistant contextual-retrieval baseline; no file/corpus migration or production use follows from this work without evidence/PIT/tenant-erasure acceptance.
> **Handoff 2026-07-22 — Robinhood cap resilience deployment.** The implementation is committed
> (`9c208190`) and latest `origin/main` is merged (`e943e9b9`), but landing stopped in the full
> Vitest gate because `better-sqlite3` was compiled under Node 26 while the required Node 24 runtime
> loaded it. Rebuild dependencies under Node 24, rerun `scripts/land.sh`, then complete PR checks,
> protected merge, Coolify SHA verification, and live Robinhood save/proposal verification. Full
> command sequence: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-22-robinhood-cap-resilience-handoff.md`.

> **2026-07-22 — Robinhood guardrail cap resilience (CODEX, branch
> `codex/robinhood-cap-fix`).** Make policy saves independent of transient broker account-list
> failures when account readiness is unchanged, while retaining verification for account selection
> and autonomy activation. Resolve effective opening order/daily caps against current buying power
> or NAV so oversized absolute settings cannot produce infeasible proposals; make percentage mode
> the default for blank dual-mode settings while preserving explicit legacy dollar settings. Focused
> regressions, lint, TypeScript, and production build are green. Full Vitest completion remains
> pending because the repo config serializes the suite and the shared host was under concurrent load.
> Next: land through the normal PR gate and verify the exact production SHA plus a Robinhood save.

> **2026-07-22 — Usage telemetry v2 + shared-package pin-check combined landing (PR #1889).** The
> reviewed #1890 workflow correction is subsumed into #1889 to avoid two serialized full CI cycles.
> Keep auto-merge off until the combined final head passes hosted `gitleaks`, `check-pin`, required
> `verify`, and zero-thread review. PRs #1890 and #1780 are closed as superseded; their branches are
> retained. After #1889 merges, verify the exact Coolify release and one new authenticated strict-v2
> ACK.
> **2026-07-22 — Mobile auth exchange CSRF follow-up (CODEX, PR #1888).** Keep
> `/api/mobile/auth/exchange` unauthenticated for the native client, but do not classify it as a
> public-prefix early return: it must pass `checkSameOrigin` before the one-time code/verifier
> handoff. Verify the focused middleware/route tests and required hosted gate, then merge and
> verify the exact auto-deployed SHA.
> **2026-07-22 — Collapse duplicate pending CI verifies (CODEX, branch
> `codex/ci-queue-collapse`).** Keep `cancel-in-progress: false` so an active suite can finish,
> but remove the per-SHA concurrency suffix so GitHub retains only the newest pending run per
> workflow/ref. Verify the workflow regression, open a ready PR, arm auto-merge, and monitor the
> queue without interrupting the three active full suites.

> **2026-07-19 - Three new RapidAPI-backed enrichment providers (CLAUDE, branch
> `claude/model-availability-session-handoff-362fd3`).** No roadmap scope change; market-data
> redundancy only. Owner-directed: add Mboum Finance, YH Finance 15, and an Alpha Vantage
> RapidAPI transport (OVERVIEW fundamentals) as a dormant-unless-`RAPIDAPI_KEY`-set, quota-safe
> failover tier registered AFTER the free Yahoo scrape in `getEnrichmentProvider`. New
> `src/lib/rapidapi-quota.ts` enforces a per-provider daily cap (Mboum 16/day, YH Finance 15
> 3/day, AV-RapidAPI 500/day) AND a combined 900/day ceiling across all three, mirroring
> `alpha-vantage-key-pool.ts`'s persisted budget pattern. tsc clean, lint 0 new warnings, 33 + 13
> new tests green. Not yet landed — `scripts/land.sh` is a separate phase. Details:
> `docs/rollouts/2026-07-19-rapidapi-yahoo-av-providers.md`.
> **2026-07-21 - Native iOS mobile-first Phase 1 (CODEX, branch
> `codex/mobile-first-ios-20260721`).** Implementation and review remediation are complete in the
> isolated worktree; PR #1859 is open for protected landing. Phase 1 keeps the backend authoritative:
> native Apple audience, read-only deletion preview/final deletion admission, immediate protective
> mobile commands, and the final broker-placement state fence are server-side contract/safety work.
> Google/GitHub browser authentication uses a short-lived verifier-bound opaque handoff rather
> than a session credential in the custom callback URL.
> Release signing
> is configured for team `CC8UTF7ATG`; the XcodeGen spec is canonical and its
> generated, checked-in `.xcodeproj` is direct-buildable. Deferred after landing: device/simulator interaction QA
> on a machine with an installed
> iOS runtime, notification/background-refresh work, and any richer Coach conversation
> contract that requires a new server API.
> **2026-07-22 - Usage telemetry v2 producer adoption (CODEX, branch
> `codex/usage-telemetry-v2-20260721`).** Exact-pin shared `v2.0.0`, replace v1 wire fields with the
> strict v2 batch/event contract, freeze and legacy-drain each existing replay watermark through a
> high-water mark before strict-v2 cutover, preserve durable replay identity and old in-memory
> buffer recovery, verify cold HTTPS install plus focused/full Node 24 gates, then land only after
> the receiver's current Oracle revision has a committed exact-SHA receipt. After merge, require
> Coolify exact-SHA health and an authenticated receiver ACK before closing.

> **2026-07-20 - Corpus re-embed scoped-purge gate fix (CURSOR, branch
> `cursor/critical-bug-management-0770`).** Critical-bug sweep found that a symbol-scoped
> corpus re-embed could persist a full-docType completion stamp and thereby authorize
> `purge-legacy` to delete all legacy vectors for that docType. Patch `corpus-reembed` so
> scoped runs never stamp full-corpus completion; keep purge blocked until an unscoped run
> completes under the active embedding revision. Focused regression added in
> `test/corpus-reembed.test.ts`; run the ordered local gate, open PR, and do not run
> production `purge-legacy` until this fix is live and full-corpus completion is independently
> verified.
> **2026-07-21 - Stop placement intent authoritative-absence fix (CURSOR,
> branch `cursor/critical-bug-management-8edd`).** Narrow money-path repair from the hourly
> high-severity bug scan: a broker protective-stop placement intent created before a timed-out broker
> call must not be cleared just because a non-authoritative/live-only order list lacks the
> `clientOrderId`. Only gateways with `ordersListIncludesTerminal === true` may treat absence as
> confirmed-dead and place fresh; Robinhood-style lists keep the intent and skip the symbol to avoid
> duplicate sell stops. Focused and full gates passed; PR publication/hosted checks next.
> **2026-07-22 - RAG parent-context expansion (CODEX, branch `codex/rag-parent-expansion-20260722`).**
> Keep child chunks as the only dense/lexical/rerank candidates. Default-off
> `RAG_PARENT_CONTEXT_EXPANSION` maps final survivors back to their bounded parent context only
> after ranking, deduping sibling parents deterministically and preserving child id, score, metadata,
> and strict point-in-time semantics. The local helper and retrieval wiring are focused-test/TS/lint
> verified; tune only after the production-path evaluator shows an evidence gain within the global
> prompt budget. Do not alter the external corpus/re-embed train for this work.
> **2026-07-22 — RAG evidence-consumption receipt correction (CODEX evidence sublane).** Complete locally: strategy derives durable use only from the post-containment/post-budget prompt serialization; retrieved-but-not-consumed chunks remain diagnostic-only; stable refs propagate through strategy/chat without new raw query/prompt telemetry. Next: umbrella RAG lane reviews and lands this isolated commit after its current integration sequencing.

> **2026-07-21 - CI Runner Migration (Antigravity, branch `agent/antigravity-ci-fix`).** Replaced failing self-hosted runner `trading-live` with `ubuntu-latest` across all CI workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) in Socratic.Trade. The Mac self-hosted runner environment was corrupted after Hetzner failure. Scheduled to land via `scripts/land.sh` to unblock 38 pending PRs.
> **2026-07-21 - CI queue recovery (GROK + CODEX, branch `monet/ci-runner-and-queue-fixes`).** Remove all workflow targets for absent `trading-live`; keep PR code on the two Coolify `socratic-ci` runners and trusted CI-failure reporting on `socratic-deploy`; remove smoke from PR events; keep an active required verification alive while GitHub collapses superseded pending heads; and repair the six stale current-main test assertions that would otherwise fail the first durable run. Land this dependency first, verify its exact production SHA, then drain PRs serially in review/dependency order without runner-service restarts.
> **2026-07-21 - CI queue recovery (GROK + CODEX, branch `monet/ci-runner-and-queue-fixes`).** Remove all workflow targets for absent `trading-live`; keep PR code on the two Coolify `socratic-ci` runners and trusted CI-failure reporting on `socratic-deploy`; remove smoke from PR events; keep an active required verification alive while GitHub collapses superseded pending heads; remove synthetic production enrichment fallback data; make bracket permission side-specific; and repair the focused tests exposed by the first durable run. Land this dependency first, verify its exact production SHA, then drain PRs serially in review/dependency order without runner-service restarts.
> **2026-07-24 - Coolify/Hetzner runners only (CURSOR, branch `cursor/coolify-runners-only-14e5`).** Owner correction: do not use GitHub-hosted Actions. CI runs on ci-cpx32 systemd runners; deploy/reviews on the Coolify prod host. Route `sentry-ci-report` off missing `socratic-deploy` onto `socratic-ci`; sudo-free `gh` + Playwright without `--with-deps`; add `scripts/monitor-coolify-runners.sh` for frequent Coolify/Hetzner health checks.
> **2026-07-19 - Land the #1771/#1773/#1777 chain, then run the corpus re-embed to completion
> (owner-directed pickup, multiple lanes).** Next actions, in order: (1) land **#1771**
> (SiliconFlow bge-m3 embed-price 10x undercount fix — auto-merge armed, no open findings,
> queued on the single-lane Hetzner CI runner); (2) land **#1773** (this session-handoff note —
> 6 Codex P2 threads fixed and resolved this pass); (3) land **#1777** (`corpus-reembed`

> **2026-07-18 - PR #1760 review closeout (CODEX, branch `codex/pr1760-review-fixes`).** Resolve all
> four actionable review threads in an isolated Codex lane: retain both shared-package HMAC and
> documented bearer webhook authentication, keep proposal attribution in policy namespace and align
> the missed usage-budget assertions, and delete unsafe review/worktree artifacts. PR #1760 raced to

> the fixes on top of that exact main. Local Node 24 gates are green (lint, TypeScript, 4,837 tests,
> build). Finish self-hosted checks, merge #1761, and production-verify the exact auto-deployed SHA.

> **2026-07-18 - Admin Server Stats reliability (CODEX, branch `codex/socratic-infra-panel-reliability`).** No roadmap scope change; infrastructure observability only. Final hardening adds bounded provider JSON and Coolify normalization, validated Hetzner metric envelopes with stale-series retention, strict client-envelope validation, and the coordinated `Server Stats` naming. Focused Node 24 tests are 19/19; the independent P2 warning-expansion finding is fixed and re-review is pending. Serialize the exact-tree full gate, then publish through PR/required checks/protected merge, Coolify auto-deploy, and exact production-SHA health verification. In-app Browser QA remains unavailable because the listed browser-control runtime was not callable; local SSR smoke returned HTTP 200 with `Server Stats` content.
> **2026-07-18 - Admin smoke memory headroom (CODEX).** Lower the CI-only Playwright Node heap
> ceiling from 2560 MiB to 2048 MiB after the admin PR's webServer exited 137 under the 3 GiB
> runner cap; rerun required checks and verify merge/deploy.

## 2026-07-18 — Admin console shell parity (CODEX)

- [x] Match the admin frame to the normal console chrome geometry and tokens.
- [x] Keep logo/name and a functional profile popover visible on admin pages.
- [x] Keep account scope, Start/Resume/STOP, and Run once controls absent from admin.
- [x] Preserve admin tabs as the left rail and normalize all admin labels to title case.
- [x] Rename the server panel to Server Stats without changing `/admin/server` or API routes.
- [x] Keep the mobile admin header within narrow viewports by hiding the full brand at small breakpoints.
- [x] Prevent profile-menu logout prefetch from triggering the side-effectful `/logout` GET.
- [x] Run Node 24 lint, TypeScript, full Vitest, and production build gates.
- [ ] Land through `scripts/land.sh`, then verify the auto-deployed production SHA and health.
> **2026-07-18 - PR #1735 proposed-model attribution P2 (CODEX, local-only branch `codex/pr1735-proposal-attribution`).**
> Preserve the exact policy/OpenRouter identifier for `TradeProposal.proposedByModel`, separately

> **2026-07-18 - PR #1735 review cleanup round 2 (CODEX on `agent/ag-recovery-v48-migration`).**
> Address the fresh Codex comments by preserving company-name display casing in securities imports

> **2026-07-18 - PR #1736 review cleanup (CODEX on `monet/model-identity-shared`).**
> Merged latest `origin/main`, kept the shared model-identity helper behavior, and restored

> **2026-07-18 - CI event-SHA checkout pin (CODEX, PR #1742 integrated into PR #1739).**
> Classifier checkouts now pin the event SHA. Security deliberately keeps full history for Gitleaks.
> Diff/YAML/actionlint checks passed; final gate and deployment follow the parent routing PR.

> **2026-07-18 - CI shallow-checkout recovery (CODEX, PR #1741 integrated into PR #1739).**
> Classify jobs compare base/head endpoint trees after shallow fetches. Security deliberately keeps

> **2026-07-18 - Coolify CI runner routing unblock (CODEX, branch `codex/coolify-ci-runner-routing`).**
> Route required PR checks and PR-visible helper workflows from GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` to the
> dedicated Coolify Hetzner CI lane (`[self-hosted, socratic-ci]`), recover the exited runner
> containers through the Coolify service API, and make Gitleaks compatible with the `/_work`

> inherits write permissions and secrets.

> **2026-07-17 - OpenRouter Model Stats Canonicalization (Antigravity, branch `antigravity/openrouter-universal-routing`).** Implemented server-side model-id canonicalization (`cleanModelId`) inside `aggregateModelStats` and `normalizeBenchmarkSummaries` in `src/lib/model-stats.ts` to strip provider prefixes (like `openai/`, `google/`, etc.) from qualified OpenRouter model IDs. This ensures that usage, latency, closed trades, and benchmark summaries are aggregated and mapped back to their bare catalog model base names (e.g., `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gemini-3.5-flash`), preventing stats split and lookup mismatch in the Model Stats drawer. Verified via vitest and compiler checks. Rollout: `docs/rollouts/2026-07-17-openrouter-model-stats-canonicalization.md`.
## 2026-07-16 — OpenRouter Catalog Integration & JSON Repair (ANTIGRAVITY)

Added OpenRouter models to `app/ui/llm-model-catalog.ts` so they can be selected for Green and Red teams. Local response healing via `jsonrepair` integrated globally via `extractJsonPayload` without model-specific fallback calls. `better-sqlite3` native modules rebuilt for Node 24. Tests passed, ready for `main` deployment.

> **2026-07-17 - SEC/RAG Backfill: Advanced RAG Backfill Improvements (Antigravity/AG, branch `agent/ag-rag-backfill-p3`).** Implemented Advanced RAG Backfill improvements (RAG-B08, RAG-B09, RAG-B10, RAG-B13, RAG-B14). Optimized the SEC filings discovery pipeline to check stashed SQLite filings first, dynamically skip online discovery if enough stashed filings satisfy the run's cap, and globally sort the queue breadth-first (newest 10-K, then newest 10-Q). Implemented dynamic raw-artifact local caching in the queue worker to bypass duplicate network fetches. Added a two-stage RAG query (scouting all candidates dynamically with `limit = 1` and deep-scanning finalists + holdings with `limit = 8`), grouping narrative chunks and structured facts/Form-4 transactions cards into prompt-injected symbol dossiers. Expanded the admin coverage dashboard at `/api/admin/rag-coverage` to query the entire database directly and report model, parser, and date ranges. Fully verified type safety, Next.js build, and 51/51 tests passing. Ready to push and merge.

> **2026-07-16 - SEC/RAG Backfill: Phase 3 — HTML Parsing and Chunker (Antigravity/AG, branch `agent/ag-rag-backfill-p3`).** Implements cheerio-based HTML parser (`parseFilingHtml` in `src/lib/web-sources/sec-parser.ts`) to strip script/style/hidden tags, normalize Item/Part section headers, and reconstruct clean pipe-delimited Markdown tables (grouping/splitting large tables to fit token caps). Updated chunker in `src/lib/rag/chunk.ts` to be section-aware (resetting overlap across sections) and use token-aware estimation. Integrated this parser in `ingestFiling` inside `src/lib/web-sources/sec-filings.ts` to ingest bodies with parser revision `sec-edgar-filing-v2`. Verified via newly added unit test suite in `test/sec-parser.test.ts` (100% green), existing `sec-filings` tests, and a successful Next.js production build check. Opening PR.

> **2026-07-15 - SEC/RAG Backfill: Phase 2 — Discovery and Archive (Antigravity/AG).** Implements Phase 2 (Discovery and Archive) of the SEC/RAG 1,000-stock high-yield backfill plan. Built a host-wide `SecRateLimiter` class (token bucket, 4 req/sec default) with dynamic 429 `Retry-After` backoff handling. Integrated this rate limiter into `politeFetch` calls in `http.ts` for all `.sec.gov` requests. Implemented a local raw-artifact caching layer in `sec-filings.ts` to check, save, and retrieve SEC documents locally before hitting the network. Added historical submissions JSON shard traversal (supporting filings listed in `filings.files` when limit is not met by `recent`). Created the `fetchFilingDirectory` helper to download and parse `index.json` directory structures for future exhibit resolution. Verified via newly added test suite in `test/sec-backfill-p2.test.ts` (100% green), existing `sec-filings` tests, and a successful Next.js production build check. Merged as PR #1665.

## SEC/RAG 1,000-stock implementation train

**Status: In progress; corpus writes gated**

**2026-07-22 routing boundary:** strategy callers must declare information needs. Current
prices, portfolio/positions, orders, SEC XBRL facts, and Form 4 transactions stay deterministic;
only filing/transcript/lesson/research narrative is eligible for semantic retrieval. Unknown needs
fail closed. Next integration is to make the same contract the shared entry point for chat and the
evidence-consumption receipt, without changing the trading verdict path.

- **[~] Wave A — prerequisite truth:** the versioned/checksummed universe acceptance contract and durable
  job/task state with leases, strict transitions, retries, dead-letter/quarantine, verification receipts, and
  replay invariants merged in PR #1543 after local/hosted gates. Corrected universe selection, census truth, and
  adversarial integration remain in progress. Three post-merge P2 durability findings (failure reasons, checksum
  immutability, lease config) are locally green on `codex/sec-rag-foundation-postmerge` in ready PR #1559.
  Production is verified on foundation release `cbe3e532`; hosted follow-up acceptance and corpus gates remain.
- **[~] Wave B — source correctness:** discover recent plus historical submission shards and filing exhibits;
  archive immutable raw artifacts; enforce one aggregate SEC limiter; parse DOM/iXBRL sections, tables, units,
  contexts, and footnotes; chunk against provider token budgets.
- **[~] Wave C — structured and searchable evidence:** normalize XBRL, insider, ownership, offering, and event
  facts; add a true corpus-wide lexical index; fuse dense/lexical recall, rerank wide, diversify, and return
  typed evidence packets with strict point-in-time filtering. The read-only FTS5 source in
  `src/lib/rag/corpus-wide-lexical.ts` is now wired default-off beside dense recall before one rerank,
  with tenant, rights, committed-version, and stale-legacy guards.
- **[ ] Wave D — evaluation and consumption:** build real-EDGAR parser/fact/retrieval/grounding fixtures and
  metrics; replace the generic three-chunk strategy blob with issuer-scoped scout/deep dossiers and verified
  evidence references.
  - **[~] Production-path retrieval evaluator (2026-07-21):** `eval:rag-production` calls
    `retrieveContextDetailedWithStatus` with immutable authoritative-as-of timestamps, real vector-id
    diagnostics plus stable provenance relevance selectors, machine-readable relevance/PIT/coverage/latency/usage receipts, and explicit comparison labels.
    Curate version-controlled JSON cases from frozen EDGAR evidence and run controlled shadow comparisons before changing defaults.
  - **[~] Hosted-inference candidate (2026-07-21):** benchmark Pinecone `/embed` and `/rerank` directly
    against frozen candidate pools before assuming self-hosted or routed BGE/Cohere is best. This is bounded
    by absolute CLI caps, read-only, account-availability-gated, and it never touches the production index.
- **[ ] Wave E — controlled operations:** only after gates, run shadow 10 -> 25 -> 100 -> 300 -> 1,000 breadth-
  first waves with cost/rate/failure breakers, reconciliation, dual-read/write, rollback, and freshness SLOs.

The highest-yield backfill order remains: freeze the exact 1,000-CIK universe plus a private priority overlay;
archive immutable raw SEC artifacts broadly; embed 10-K/10-Q decision sections, material 8-K exhibits, and only
entitled transcripts selectively; retain XBRL/fundamentals as structured facts; checkpoint by CIK/accession; and
expand only after each 10 -> 25 -> 100 -> 300 -> 1,000 wave passes coverage, citation, PIT, cost, and failure gates.
The production bulk worker must consume historical submissions shards rather than recent-only discovery. Crash
repair must combine provider-page ghost cleanup with a local keyset whole-commit verifier; never page an exact-set
commit reconciliation in a way that can split one commit across pages, and never rewrite PIT intervals/heads during
repair. No 1,000-stock provider or corpus write is authorized yet.

Node 24 remains the supported runtime. Node 26 is installed on the host but is not adopted while `.nvmrc`, CI,
production, and the `better-sqlite3` native ABI are pinned to 24.

## Codex Audit Wave 0: Base Guardrails
**Status: In Progress**

- **[x] PR 1: X0.1 & X0.2 Safety Maintenance & Draining Fence**
  - X0.1 Safety Maintenance Coordinator: Run all side-effecting sweeps (fill reconciliation, stale intents, stale exits, synthetic stops) strictly before strategy admission, with strict network deadlines (15s). Ensures side effects execute exactly once per tick and never hang the singleflight guard.
  - X0.2 Draining Fence: Hard pre-placement veto if the account's state is `draining` or `deleted`. Capture `accountNumber` and `policyRevision` onto the `strategy_runs` snapshot.

- **[x] PR 2: X0.3 Exit Replacement State Machine**
  - Migrated limit order market-replacements to a robust, database-backed state machine.
  - Added original order detail columns (symbol, side, type, quantity, filled quantity) to SQLite schema and reconstructed orders when missing from broker.
  - Implemented auto-mode-off continuation and full reconciliation/recovery for in-flight `replacement_submitted` rows.

# Improvement Plan - Socratic Trade

Eight-phase roadmap to make the dashboard genuinely autonomous, more accurate,
measurable, customizable, and easier to operate. The current codebase is treated
as partially complete; implementation should preserve working controls while
filling the missing pieces.

> **2026-07-04 - Coach/framework primitives slice (Codex, issue #473).** No roadmap scope change.
> This branch is a focused primitive-wiring pass: the decision-trace coach flow can now attach a

> **2026-07-04 - Test Account + usage-limit email alerts (Codex).**
> Branch `codex/restore-test-account-option` restores an explicit local mock paper account option
> labeled `Test Account - Local Mock Paper Account`. It is addable for simulation/learning trades but

>    **reservation** now closes this: `reserveLlmBudget`/`reserveLlmRunBudget`/`releaseLlmReservation` in
>    `src/lib/llm-budget.ts`, CAS'd in the `settings` KV row like `acquireStrategyLock` (no migration,
>    5-min TTL, fail-closed → skip LLM, default-OFF). `runStrategyOnce` reserves its worst-case estimate
>    at the budget gate and releases in the `finally`, so a concurrent same-user run sees the hold and
>    skips LLM instead of both overshooting. See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-01-llm-budget-reservation-toctou.md`.
> 2. **Chat-path spend coverage.** `/api/chat` LLM spend does not route through `withLlmGeneration`, so
>    it is outside the budget gate. If a *total* per-user/day ceiling (strategy + chat) is desired,
>    wire the chat LLM path through the same `assertWithinLlmBudget(userId)` guard.
> 3. **Multi-account budget target.** The ceiling is keyed by `userId`, so it is a per-*user* daily cap
>    that spans all of that user's accounts, not a per-*account* cap. If a user runs several accounts and
>    the intent is an independent budget per account, the gate would need to key on the account id (and
>    the ledger read filter + the Settings UI would need a per-account budget field). Today it is
>    deliberately per-user so one runaway account can't drain a shared daily allowance unnoticed.
> 4. **(Earlier-noted) `strategy.ts` god-module split** (~3k lines) remains a separate large refactor.

## Current Status

Hosting topology: production remains `socratictrade.com` on the
`~/apps/trading-live` worktree / pm2 `trading` / port `4000`. The editable
integration checkout uses the single pre-production beta hostname
`trading-beta.jays.services` -> `~/Code/Agentic Trading` / pm2 `trading-main` /
port `4001`. Do not add a second dev/beta hostname in code, docs, Tunnel
ingress, DNS, or Access configuration.

Secrets/config topology (2026-06-25): `.env.local` is git-ignored and is **not** a
secret source (only the secret-free `.env.example` is tracked), and **Infisical is
the authoritative source of truth for secret values** — the app launches through
the Infisical runner (`npm run start:secrets`), which injects them at startup, and
`REQUIRE_SECRETS_MANAGER=1` makes prod refuse to boot off a local `.env.local`. See
`docs/secrets.md` and `docs/deployment.md` → "Configuration & secrets". (The former
GCP runner was removed — Infisical is the single path.) The box authenticates with the machine
identity's **Client ID + Client Secret** (universal auth, long-lived; the runner mints a short-lived
token each launch — a raw `INFISICAL_TOKEN` is only a fallback and the Client Secret is NOT that
token). Current Coolify production injects that identity through `scripts/coolify-prod-start.sh`;
the retired Mac rollback cutover remains scripted in `scripts/infisical-prod-cutover.sh`. Shared
App-A/B secrets are pulled via an app-wins overlay
(`INFISICAL_SHARED_PROJECT_ID` + its own Client ID/Secret). This documents existing behavior; no phase
scope, timeline, or approach changed.

| # | Phase | Spec | Status |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Autonomy loop | `docs/phase-1-autonomy-loop.md` | Mostly implemented; hardening/tests remain |
| 2 | Correctness fixes | `docs/phase-2-correctness.md` | Partially implemented; sector attribution incomplete |
| 3 | Performance tracking | `docs/phase-3-performance.md` | Partially implemented; paper portfolio projection, short/cover P&L branches, broker-backed pending-fill reconciliation, and persisted `executionMode` for proposals/snapshots/fills exist. Remaining: deeper attribution/tax reporting and broader broker-paper/live lifecycle tests |
| 4 | Market data and scoring | `docs/phase-4-market-data-scoring.md` | Multi-factor scoring + TTL cache live; Finnhub/FMP/Alpha Vantage/Yahoo enrichment and VIX macro context are wired. 2026-06-16: `fcfYield`/`debtToEquity`/`epsGrowth` now feed `valueScore`/`qualityScore` and the Market Scan table. 2026-06-16 (web-sources): fixed a real bug where the scan merge dropped those fields + `senateTrades` (extracted exhaustive `applyEnrichment`); congressional + SEC-insider overlays now populate `senateTrades`/`insiderSentiment`. 2026-06-19: optional `webull-unofficial` quote enrichment is available for read-only market fields only, disabled by default and never used for execution/fills. 2026-06-19: quote-source attribution now derives broker providers (`alpaca-quotes`, `robinhood-quotes`), OHLC cache sharing is explicit, shared history fills can fulfill pending misses, and Massive grouped daily VWAP can enrich scan rows when available. 2026-06-23: quote-resolvable custom Additional Watchlist symbols missing from the Nasdaq screener are carried into Market Scan via Yahoo quote-only rows, with concrete warnings when a custom ticker cannot be priced; broad dynamic base universes now include S&P 100/OEF, Russell 2000/IWM, Nasdaq Composite, NYSE Composite, and an FT Wilshire 5000 free-screener proxy, then rank down before enrichment/LLM prompting; the candidate cap and below-cutoff outlier reserve are per-user policy settings instead of env-only defaults. 2026-06-24: MCP/provider evaluation documented; direct APIs remain the production hot path, while MCP is recommended for provider research, field exploration, and trial benchmarking only unless normalized through the cache/provenance layer. |
| 5 | Frontend refactor and charts | `docs/phase-5-dashboard-refactor.md` | Partially implemented; dashboard charts, market-scan columns, activity feed, kill-switch confirmation, actionable scan empty states, readable activity summaries, custom ticker validation, and visible runtime/render error surfaces are live |
| 6 | Customization and notifications | `docs/phase-6-customization-risk-notifications.md` | Partially implemented; profiles, risk controls, webhook settings, multi-channel direct delivery, and legacy-event direct-delivery bridge exist; notification polish remains |
| 7 | AI strategy learning loop | `docs/phase-7-strategy.md` | In progress; trade-thesis metadata, red-team debate hook, and learning-loop scaffolding exist. Outcome-aware thesis/regime/sector scorecards, Bayesian shrinkage, `candidates_considered`, `signal_snapshot`, chosen+skipped EvidenceDigest, signal-efficacy, confidence-calibration, durable skipped-name counterfactual materialization, and a 20-lot tuner gate are live. 2026-06-23: broker-paper scorecards/tuning/post-mortem now read the paper bucket with explicit `executionMode` instead of live/Test heuristics. 2026-06-25 correction: persisted MAE/MFE per closed lot (post-mortem `upsertFillExcursionsByKey`), the tuner's consumption of materialized missed opportunities, and true candidate-vs-baseline OOS validation for proposed scoring weights are all LIVE — the OOS gate now also surfaces a "not out-of-sample validated" caution when it cannot evaluate. Remaining: richer per-document digests and more tests around red-team fallback behavior. |
| 8 | Cockpit UI and Strategy Studio | `docs/phase-8-cockpit-ui.md` | Cockpit shell, tabs, Strategy Studio, and strategy tuning API are live. 2026-06-16: full redesign on branch `ui-redesign` — Tailwind 4 + Recharts + Motion, dark/light themes, command bar + Portfolio rail + tabbed workspace, slide-over feeds, modal settings, learning-loop charts. 2026-06-19/20: first-run setup state, Test/Paper/Brokerage legibility, mobile scroll recovery, compact mobile portfolio summary, grouped Operate universe controls with a one-time S&P 500 default migration, Smart Money ticker drawer fallback, and a persisted ticker-logo display preference are live. 2026-06-23: Strategy Studio owns editable Green/Red Team model choices, Run once works as a stopped-system manual proposal check, workspace/feed tabs persist across browser refresh, Macro/Market Scan hover text and title-case headings were expanded, provider/API errors are translated to plain English, the mode banner can be compacted but not hidden, a readiness strip is visible, live approval requires typed server confirmation, Settings base-index buttons support S&P/Nasdaq mutually-exclusive families plus broad dynamic universe counts, Market Scan exposes a direct gauge shortcut to Settings -> Data for candidate cap/outlier reserve controls, and the Accounts list stacks/actions better on mobile after desktop/tablet/mobile screenshot QA. 2026-06-24: shared ticker buttons now give Macro movers/news tickers the same hover/click drilldown behavior as Market Scan. 2026-06-27: unauthenticated Robinhood MCP rows show `OAuth Needed`/Reconnect rather than plain Connected, recoverable broker fallbacks render as Activity diagnostics, and the Account readiness strip/Start/Run blockers now fail closed when broker OAuth, credentials, selected-account availability, agentic eligibility, or balance/portfolio reads are broken. Remaining: replace browser prompt with a richer in-app confirmation modal and broaden mobile/keyboard e2e coverage |
| 9 | Backend web sources (scraped signals) | `docs/phase-9-web-sources.md` | 2026-06-16/17 (branch `web-sources`): `src/lib/web-sources/` reads no-free-API signals server-side — Senate eFD + Capitol Trades **congressional trades**, **SEC EDGAR Form 4** insider, and **FINRA daily short-volume** — with polite cached fetch, persistent daily refresh, scheduler hook, event candidate union, source attribution, scan/prompt/UI wiring, and a never-fabricate guarantee. Also: fixed the dropped-enrichment-field bug, plumbed technical/risk fields, `signal_snapshot` audit, thesis×regime + signal-efficacy + confidence-calibration learning, 20-lot gate, edge-aware sizing. Follow-ups now tracked in Phase 10 |
| 10 | Stronger signals, learning & UI (v2 plan) | `docs/phase-10-signals-learning-ui-v2.md` | In progress on `phase-10`: positioning/smart-money deterministic sub-score, sector scorecard, full EvidenceDigest for chosen+skipped, SEC 8-K bulletins with item-label enrichment, market breadth/internals, expanded FRED/macro metrics, Macro tab, Fama-French, Cboe SKEW/VVIX, CFTC COT, Congress.Trade confidence-capped composite + PIT export evaluator with App A `validationReadiness` / `pitValidity` fail-closed gates, technical signals, keyed OHLC cascade, batched Voyage/Pinecone RAG scaffold with paced/capped 8-K ingestion, 2026-06-20 tenant-safe RAG metadata/filter/backoff hardening with raw-user credential lookup preservation, symbol drilldown with 0-100 signal thresholds, price chart with VWAP overlay, Market Scan `vs VWAP`, first-pass prompt compaction, factor-bucket scorecards, current-scan skipped counterfactual summaries, durable/mature-horizon skipped-name counterfactual rows, configurable red-team conviction threshold, and an optional de-risk-in-crisis opening-exposure cap are live. Remaining: real App A PIT export validation once App A marks `historicalValidationReady=true`, broader adaptive prompt compaction/cache layout, production-grade filing/news digests, analyst/earnings revisions, SEC XBRL facts, post-mortem/tuning use of missed-opportunity rows, full learning-matrix UI, and broader scoring-threshold settings. |
| 11 | Multi-user & API-key management (plan) | `docs/phase-11-multi-user.md` | In progress: default-user scaffolding exists; connected accounts now keep API keys server-only in dashboard snapshots, encrypt stored credentials, preserve credentials on metadata edits, route Alpaca through the active connected account, sync Robinhood through MCP OAuth/status instead of manual keys, support Alpaca MCP client connections alongside REST, keep account connection buttons persistent in UI for multi-broker setups, derive Alpaca paper vs brokerage environment dynamically via account number `PA...` or API key `PK...`, enforce required account numbers for Alpaca, preserve user-entered Alpaca account labels in the Accounts list while showing Paper/Brokerage as environment metadata, derive execution state as Test vs Paper vs Brokerage, present supported account connect buttons in Accounts, keep Paper accounts optional and user-selected, expose a hardened Robinhood MCP HTTP/SSE transport plus `/api/broker/mcp/health`, use that health check to distinguish stored Robinhood rows from authenticated MCP sessions (`OAuth Needed` + Reconnect), expose server-side `accountReadiness` so broker visibility/backfill cannot masquerade as selected-account usability, ship Settings → Connections for provider keys and connection status, let users choose separate Green Team and Red Team OpenAI/xAI models in Strategy Studio with Green fallback, route major provider/LLM calls through `resolveApiKey(service,userId)`, scope strategy locks, paper projections, learning scorecards, tax reads, notifications, reflections, dashboard callbacks, and prompt cache keys by user, route high-impact API handlers through verified middleware identity via `resolveRequestUser`, explicitly share public/env-key market data while keeping user-keyed history private by default, track pending public OHLC misses so later shared fills can refresh prior requesters without spending another user's key, and add Infisical wrappers, local Gitleaks scanning, Sentry runtime hooks, redacted Langfuse LLM traces, npm Dependabot, Litestream scripts, and Playwright smoke tests. 2026-06-24: direct Alpaca Add Account no longer shows the endpoint explainer, live default endpoint is `https://api.alpaca.markets` while Paper remains `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2`, and Alpaca account-type parsing is best-effort from broker-returned account subtype fields. 2026-06-27: broker/data fallbacks in the account dashboard path now emit throttled `recoverable_issue` audit events. 2026-06-28: site auth now relies on Auth.js Google sessions instead of Cloudflare Access headers; `AUTH_SECRET` arms fail-closed auth, `/logout` redirects to app `/login`, and empty `ALLOWED_EMAILS` allows only primary operator aliases. GitHub CI/e2e/security workflows are deferred until push credentials include `workflow` scope. M3 complete (2026-06-21): per-user policy/profiles/prompt/tuning fully scoped; global settings seeds removed; one-time migration to copy legacy global rows to 'local' user; DELETE /api/profiles/[id] route added; two-user isolation verified by test/per-user-policy-isolation.test.ts. M6 real identity/auth is implemented with Auth.js Google fail-closed middleware, request-scoped SSR snapshots, `/login`, `/logout`, and visible signed-in/Sign out UI. M7 account deletion is implemented with preview/prepare/final-delete API, multi-step Settings -> Data UI, broker/Google/Apple limitations, in-flight trading blockers, per-user OAuth/token cleanup, and hashed deletion audit. Remaining: complete data isolation audit for any newer fills/snapshots/proposals/learning tables and add provider-account-id identity mapping before Apple private-relay identities become first-class. |

## Integrations (outside the phase roadmap)

- **congress.trade data-share — push** (2026-06-22, `docs/congress-trade-share.md`):
  outbound, default-OFF forwarding of this app's company refs + daily closes +
  the `^GSPC` series to `congress.trade` (App A)'s idempotent import endpoint, so
  the *shared* daily FMP quota is spent once. After-scan refs hook + once-per-day
  nightly `prices`/`spx` batch + an admin trigger route. Gated on
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_TOKEN` + `CONGRESS_SHARE_ENABLED`; token is server-only. As of
  2026-06-30, the outbound payload types, API path constants, and runtime schema
  checks come from `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`.
- **congress.trade — receive/consume** (2026-06-22, `docs/congress-trade-consume.md`,
  contract `docs/push-to-app-b.md`): default-OFF cache-aside reads of App A's
  `/api/market/*` (history first tier), App A as the congressional source via
  `/api/transactions` (token-gated), and a push receiver (webhook + SSE) feeding the
  scan's web-signal overlay. Shared transaction/event contracts now come from
  `@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared`. Inert until App A's read endpoints are live.
  Round 3 (pending App A slots): push `volume`+`insider`+`shortVolume` on the nightly batch.
- **congress.trade — return-path + analytics ownership reply** (2026-06-24,
  `docs/congress-trade-app-b-reply.md`): accepted App A's analytics ownership split
  (they own congressional-trade analytics, App B owns market/price analytics) with a
  **pull/pull** transport (no aggregate pushing either way); specified the inbound
  return-path contract App A is waiting on. Both follow-up PRs are now **BUILT**
  (additive + default-OFF):
  (1) `feat/securities-import-receiver` — `POST /api/admin/securities/import`
  (bearer `APP_B_INGEST_TOKEN`, default-closed) + a local EOD cache
  (`imported_*` tables, `db-securities-import.ts`) wired as an opt-in, density-guarded
  `fetchDailyOHLC` tier, to land App A's price/spx/ref gap-fills — **BUILT 2026-06-25**
  (`docs/rollouts/2026-06-25-app-b-securities-import-fundamentals-price-targets.md`).
  (2) `congress-share.ts` `fundamentals[]`/`analyst[]` push for App A's PR #46 slots —
  built earlier via `marketQuoteToFundamentals`/`marketQuoteToAnalyst` (sourced from the
  scan's `MarketQuote`, gated `CONGRESS_SHARE_FUNDAMENTALS_ENABLED`). Numeric price targets,
  previously null, are now ALSO fillable via the opt-in FMP `price-target-consensus` provider
  (`FMP_PRICE_TARGETS_ENABLED`) — **BUILT 2026-06-25**; they thread through the enrichment
  surface onto the quote and into `marketQuoteToAnalyst`.
  (3) **Fundamentals/analyst read-back tier** — App A now exposes
  `GET /api/market/fundamentals|analyst/:ticker` (the donated tables finally have readers);
  App B reads them via `getAppAFundamentals`/`getAppAAnalyst` + a
  `CongressTradeEnrichmentProvider` seated ahead of the paid fundamentals providers, gated by its OWN
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_FUNDAMENTALS_ENABLED` (separate from the price-read `CONGRESS_TRADE_READS_ENABLED`), with a
  `CONGRESS_TRADE_MAX_STALE_DAYS` freshness cap and `NEWS_CACHE_TTL_MS` caching
  — **BUILT 2026-06-25** (`docs/congress-trade-consume.md` §1b,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-25-crossapp-consumer-reads.md`). Paid-call elimination is an **opt-in coverage
  hint** (`ENRICHMENT_SHORT_CIRCUIT_ENABLED`): the cascade hands paid providers a per-symbol set of the
  fields App A already covers (+ the analyst source) so they skip only the redundant SUB-calls (e.g. FMP's
  ratios-ttm / grades-consensus / price-target calls) while still fetching their unique fields
  (insider/senate); no whole provider is skipped → no field lost; default OFF. App A reads are merged
  across all fresh rows, freshness-gated by the data `date`, and negative-cached 1h (transport errors are
  NOT cached). A→B push wired (`APP_B_IMPORT_URL`+`APP_B_INGEST_TOKEN` on App A; App B needs the same token
  + `SECURITIES_IMPORT_HISTORY_TIER_ENABLED`).
- **congress.trade — App A handoff: new analytics endpoints + adjusted-close fix** (2026-06-25,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-06-25-app-a-handoff-integration.md`): consumes three new App A endpoints
  now live/merging (App A PRs #77/#79/#80): `GET /api/analytics/conviction` (composite 0–100
  conviction score, gated by `CONGRESS_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`), `GET /api/analytics/ticker/{T}/backtest`
  (per-ticker post-buy return stats, on-demand), and `GET /api/analytics/conflicts` (committee
  conflict-of-interest disclosures). Conviction + conflictCount wired into the daily
  `refreshCongressAnalytics` parallel fetch and the `CongressAnalytics` overlay. Yahoo adjusted-close
  fix: `fetchYahoo` now prefers `indicators.adjclose` (split+dividend-adjusted) over raw close for
  correct multi-year returns pushed to App A. **2026-06-26 update:** conviction + conflict bulletins
  now emitted in `web-sources/index.ts`; `congressAnalyticsScore` gates on `convictionDirection=BUY`
  and adds a `convictionBoost` so conviction-only tickers reach the scan candidate set. **Deferred:**
  ticker-change/delisting map (App A priority #3); bulk-snapshot bootstrap; congress-share bypass
  for adjusted-close when CONGRESS_TRADE_READS_ENABLED tier precedes Yahoo.

## Fleet-infra tooling (host-side, no product-roadmap change)

- **Retired deploy safety + CI Sentry coverage** (2026-07-11,
  `.github/workflows/sentry-ci-report.yml`, `scripts/sentry-ci-report.py`,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-11-retired-deploy-ci-observability.md`): removed the
  obsolete Mac/PM2 GitHub Actions deploy workflow so Coolify remains the only
  automatic production path, and synchronized Sentry failure/cron observation
  with the active workflow fleet. This is CI/operations hardening only; it does
  not change product scope, phase order, or acceptance criteria.

- **Effort-log union-merge safety net** (2026-07-10,
  `scripts/effort-log-union-merge.py`,
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-effort-log-union-merge-safety.md`): a stdlib-only,
  row-level, invariant-checked reconciler that merges the machine-local live
  effort board against the repo mirror (`docs/EFFORT-LOG.md`) **without ever
  dropping a live-only row**. This is host-side coordination tooling only — it
  changes no product code, ships no user-facing behavior, and does **not** alter
  the phase roadmap or acceptance checks above. **Follow-up (out of this PR's
  scope):** wire it into the always-on host-side `~/.claude-merge-shepherd/run.sh`
  30-minute driver so live/mirror reconciliation runs automatically; that cron
  lives outside this repo and touching it needs an owner-supervised session.

## Build Order

### Current landing closure (2026-07-14)

- Finish PR #1586 with immutable generation-bound transcript derivative IDs, exact provider/ledger
  receipts, heartbeat-fenced writes, active-generation retrieval, provider-first consecutive-clean
  erasure, account-deletion coverage, and independent private/shared rerank candidate pools.
- Treat Cloudflare Access application-token timestamps as authorization-token freshness only; require
  a matching signed Auth.js `loginAt` for post-deletion identity regeneration.
- Complete the ordered Node 24 gate and hostile re-review, merge #1607 and #1586 through their PRs,
  then verify zero open PRs plus the exact final production release. Transcript activation remains a
  separate owner/config decision gated on endpoint entitlement and commercial storage/display rights.

1. Phase 1 hardening: scheduler starts once, run lock works, market-hours state is visible.
2. Phase 2 correctness: estimated notional is authoritative and sector attribution covers all scan rows.
3. Phase 3 performance: snapshots, fills, Test vs broker-routed P&L, and run attribution.
4. Phase 4 data/scoring: provider abstraction, quote enrichment, TTL cache, factor scores.
5. Phase 5 dashboard: typed components, charts, visible loading/error states, better universe/watchlist UX.
6. Phase 6 customization: profiles, deterministic risk rules, webhook notifications.
7. Phase 7 strategy loop: persist learning metrics, harden red-team debate fallback, and keep short/cover disabled for Live until broker/accounting behavior is proven.
8. Phase 8 cockpit UX: harden strategy tuning tests, polish pane density, and add persisted tuning history if audit needs justify it.

## Acceptance Checks

- Required handoff verification: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, then
  `npm run build`. GitHub Actions CI (`verify` workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  mirrors this sequence and is live — PRs cannot merge until `verify` goes green.
  The security, e2e, and deploy workflows remain in `ci-pending/` (require additional
  credentials / environment setup before they can be promoted to `.github/workflows/`).
- The strategy can run autonomously while enabled, without opening the dashboard.
- `strategy_run` audit events are written inside `runStrategyOnce()` and only once per executed run.
- Daily limits count reviewed `estimated_notional`, including share-quantity market orders.
- Held positions can be attributed to sectors even when they are not top scan candidates.
- Performance summaries separate live and paper results.
- Scan candidates expose provider freshness, factor score breakdowns, and bid/ask data when available.
- Dashboard shows market session, scheduler state, performance charts, active profile, risk settings, and notification status.
- Desktop dashboard fits in one viewport with internal pane scrolling and tabbed workspaces.
- Mobile and tablet layouts use normal page scrolling with the fixed cockpit
  shell reserved for desktop widths.
- Strategy tuning proposals are review-only until the user explicitly applies them.
- Mobile/PWA/native clients use the shared backend command queue and status model;
  phones never store provider secrets, broker credentials, or MCP tokens.
- Policy enforcement deterministically handles daily limits, symbol limits, sector caps, stop-loss, and take-profit rules.
- Webhook notifications are attempted only when configured and every attempt is audited.
- Error/LLM observability stays opt-in and redacted by default for account, prompt, and credential data.
- The local SQLite database has a documented Litestream replicate/restore path before production reliance.
- Production and beta hosting stay separated: production on `socratictrade.com`
  / port `4000`; integration beta on `trading-beta.jays.services` / port `4001`;
  no duplicate dev/beta hostname.
- Agent branch landing requires a clean worktree and refuses stale semantic overlap
  when the branch and `origin/main` both changed the same files since divergence.
- Root-level manual probe artifacts such as screenshots, one-off UI scripts, and
  accidental shell-output files stay ignored so the integration worktree remains
  reserved for review and merges.
